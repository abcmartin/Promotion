	abstract = {PURPOSE: The Head and Neck Intergroup conducted a phase III randomized trial to test the benefit of adding chemotherapy to radiation in patients with unresectable squamous cell head and neck cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned between arm A (the control), single daily fractionated radiation (70 Gy at 2 Gy/d); arm B, identical radiation therapy with concurrent bolus cisplatin, given on days 1, 22, and 43; and arm C, a split course of single daily fractionated radiation and three cycles of concurrent infusional fluorouracil and bolus cisplatin chemotherapy, 30 Gy given with the first cycle and 30 to 40 Gy given with the third cycle. Surgical resection was encouraged if possible after the second chemotherapy cycle on arm C and, if necessary, as salvage therapy on all three treatment arms. Survival data were compared between each experimental arm and the control arm using a one-sided log-rank test. RESULTS: Between 1992 and 1999, 295 patients were entered on this trial. This did not meet the accrual goal of 362 patients and resulted in premature study closure. Grade 3 or worse toxicity occurred in 52% of patients enrolled in arm A, compared with 89% enrolled in arm B (P <.0001) and 77% enrolled in arm C (P <.001). With a median follow-up of 41 months, the 3-year projected overall survival for patients enrolled in arm A is 23%, compared with 37% for arm B (P =.014) and 27% for arm C (P = not significant). CONCLUSION: The addition of concurrent high-dose, single-agent cisplatin to conventional single daily fractionated radiation significantly improves survival, although it also increases toxicity. The loss of efficacy resulting from split-course radiation was not offset by either multiagent chemotherapy or the possibility of midcourse surgery.},

@article{RN143,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a risk factor for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and is a concern for patients with HPV-positive HNSCC and their partners. The prevalence of oral HPV infection before and after cancer therapy was investigated among patients with HPV16-positive and HPV16-negative HNSCC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Serial oral rinse samples (ORS) were collected from a cohort of 135 HNSCC cases as frequently as every 3 months for up to 3 years. Tumor HPV status was determined by HPV16 in situ hybridization. HPV was detected in ORS by consensus PCR and line blot hybridization. The HPV16 variants in positive oral rinse-tumor pairs were determined by sequencing. The odds of oral HPV infection among HPV16-positive and HPV16-negative cases were compared by use of generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Patients were followed for a median of 21 months and provided a median of 4 samples. Forty-four of 135 patients had HPV16-positive tumors. HPV16-positive cases were more likely than HPV16-negative cases to have an oral HPV infection detected before (odds ratio, 8.6; 95% confidence interval, 3.5-21) and after therapy (OR, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-7.4). Oral infections by HPV16 and other high-risk, but not low-risk, types were more common among HPV16-positive cases both before and after therapy. Most HPV16 variants in ORS were European, unique, and identical to that in the tumor. Persistence of a type-specific oral infection was demonstrable for as long as 5 years. CONCLUSION: Oral high-risk HPV infections are more frequent among patients with HPV16-positive than HPV16-negative HNSCC, consistent with a behavioral and/or biological disposition to infection.},

	abstract = {The cancer stem cell hypothesis states that within a tumor only a subset of cells, the "cancer stem cells" (CSC), are capable of initiating and propagating the disease. In various cancers such cells have been identified and prospectively isolated based on the presence of specific cell surface antigens. In head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, we have shown that the CSCs are contained within the CD44+ subset of tumor cells. This subset contains cells capable of initiating tumor growth in mice that recapitulates the original tumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, they have a primitive cellular morphology, express high levels of nuclear BMI1, and are arrayed in characteristic tumor microdomains. The methods used to purify this subset of tumorigenic cells, to characterize their gene expression profiles, and to identify their physical location within the context of the whole tumor are described here.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in United States women, accounting for >40,000 deaths each year. These breast tumors are comprised of phenotypically diverse populations of breast cancer cells. Using a model in which human breast cancer cells were grown in immunocompromised mice, we found that only a minority of breast cancer cells had the ability to form new tumors. We were able to distinguish the tumorigenic (tumor initiating) from the nontumorigenic cancer cells based on cell surface marker expression. We prospectively identified and isolated the tumorigenic cells as CD44(+)CD24(-/low)Lineage(-) in eight of nine patients. As few as 100 cells with this phenotype were able to form tumors in mice, whereas tens of thousands of cells with alternate phenotypes failed to form tumors. The tumorigenic subpopulation could be serially passaged: each time cells within this population generated new tumors containing additional CD44(+)CD24(-/low)Lineage(-) tumorigenic cells as well as the phenotypically diverse mixed populations of nontumorigenic cells present in the initial tumor. The ability to prospectively identify tumorigenic cancer cells will facilitate the elucidation of pathways that regulate their growth and survival. Furthermore, because these cells drive tumor development, strategies designed to target this population may lead to more effective therapies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and the prognostic significance of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p53, and p16 among patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Academic Institute of Otolaryngology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. PATIENTS: Two hundred seventy-four patients who were diagnosed as having oropharyngeal carcinoma underwent testing for the presence of the HPV genome in the nuclei of their tumor cells from January 1, 1992, through March 31, 2008. INTERVENTIONS: The HPV genome was detected by performing polymerase chain reaction-based assays and in situ hybridization on tumor tissue from paraffin blocks. Immunohistochemistry staining for p16, p53, and EGFR was also performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We used the Fisher exact test to evaluate the correlation between the clinicopathological variables and the presence of HPV in tumor cells. Survival analysis was based on the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: We detected HPV in 45 of the 274 patients (16.4%); of these, HPV-16 and -18 were identified in 42 (93.3%) of the HPV-positive tumors. The HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers were more likely to occur in females, nonsmoking individuals, and those who did not chew betel quid. The HPV-positive tumors significantly expressed p16 and were inversely associated with EGFR and p53 expression (all, P < .001). In addition, patients with tumor tissue that was positive for HPV (P = .008) and had negative expression of EGFR (P = .01), low expression of p53 (P = .01), and high expression of p16 (P = .04) had a better prognosis. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HPV, EGFR, p53, and p16 are useful biomarkers in predicting the clinical outcomes of oropharyngeal cancer.},

	abstract = {Two hundred eight primary squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck have been analyzed with respect to the presence of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, pRb. Of these, 23 tumors (11%) that preferentially localized to the tonsils revealed complete absence or dramatic reduction in the amount of pRb. Other cell cycle components, cyclin D1 and p16INK4A, which are intimately related to pRb through an autoregulatory loop, were also dramatically decreased or overexpressed, respectively, in these pRb-defective tumors. On the other hand, the majority of the pRb-defective tumors contained the wild-type p53 gene. No evidence was found for genetic defects at the Rb locus in these tumors. Very significantly, in 11 of 12 pRb-defective tonsillar tumors, but in none of 9 pRb-positive tonsillar tumors (P < 10[-7]), DNA of oncogenic human papillomavirus types was identified, providing a strong indication for a human papillomavirus-associated etiology of these tumors and suggesting the functional inactivation of the pRb protein by the viral E7 gene product. In comparison to all head and neck squamous cell carcinomas studied, the pRb-defective tonsillar tumors were in general more poorly differentiated (P = 0.0059), and they were all metastatic at the time of resection. Of particular clinical interest, despite these adverse histopathological factors, the clinical outcome for these patients was relatively favorable, strongly implying that the pRb-defective tumors responded uniformly well toward postoperative radiation therapy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The presence of distant metastases affects the therapeutic regime in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. This study evaluated the necessity to undertake bone scanning, chest computed tomography and abdominal ultrasonography in patients presenting with primary advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis, university setting. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-three patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who were scheduled for major surgery underwent screening for distant metastases. Chest, head and neck computed tomography, abdominal ultrasonography and bone scanning were performed in all patients. RESULTS: Distant metastases were detected in 5.52 per cent of the 163 patients. All of these patients had locoregional advanced (stage IV) tumours. Computed tomography scanning of the lungs revealed metastases in six patients. Bone metastases were found in three patients. Only one patient with primary liver metastases was detected by abdominal ultrasonography; this patient also had pulmonary metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography of the thorax is the most important technique for screening patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinomas caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) are associated with favorable survival, but the independent prognostic significance of tumor HPV status remains unknown. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the association between tumor HPV status and survival among patients with stage III or IV oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma who were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy (with acceleration by means of concomitant boost radiotherapy) with standard-fractionation radiotherapy, each combined with cisplatin therapy, in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Proportional-hazards models were used to compare the risk of death among patients with HPV-positive cancer and those with HPV-negative cancer. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 4.8 years. The 3-year rate of overall survival was similar in the group receiving accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy and the group receiving standard-fractionation radiotherapy (70.3% vs. 64.3%; P=0.18; hazard ratio for death with accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.13), as were the rates of high-grade acute and late toxic events. A total of 63.8% of patients with oropharyngeal cancer (206 of 323) had HPV-positive tumors; these patients had better 3-year rates of overall survival (82.4%, vs. 57.1% among patients with HPV-negative tumors; P<0.001 by the log-rank test) and, after adjustment for age, race, tumor and nodal stage, tobacco exposure, and treatment assignment, had a 58% reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.66). The risk of death significantly increased with each additional pack-year of tobacco smoking. Using recursive-partitioning analysis, we classified our patients as having a low, intermediate, or high risk of death on the basis of four factors: HPV status, pack-years of tobacco smoking, tumor stage, and nodal stage. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor HPV status is a strong and independent prognostic factor for survival among patients with oropharyngeal cancer. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00047008.)},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: A multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial was undertaken in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma to address (1) the validity of using pathologic risk features, established from a previous study, to determine the need for, and dose of, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT); (2) the impact of accelerating PORT using a concomitant boost schedule; and (3) the importance of the overall combined treatment duration on the treatment outcome. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Of 288 consecutive patients with advanced disease registered preoperatively, 213 fulfilled the trial criteria and went on to receive therapy predicated on a set of pathologic risk features: no PORT for the low-risk group (n = 31); 57.6 Gy during 6.5 weeks for the intermediate-risk group (n = 31); and, by random assignment, 63 Gy during 5 weeks (n = 76) or 7 weeks (n = 75) for the high-risk group. Patients were irradiated with standard techniques appropriate to the site of disease and likely areas of spread. The study end points were locoregional control (LRC), survival, and morbidity. RESULTS: Patients with low or intermediate risks had significantly higher LRC and survival rates than those with high-risk features (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0001, respectively), despite receiving no PORT or lower dose PORT, respectively. For high-risk patients, a trend toward higher LRC and survival rates was noted when PORT was delivered in 5 rather than 7 weeks. A prolonged interval between surgery and PORT in the 7-week schedule was associated with significantly lower LRC (p = 0.03) and survival (p = 0.01) rates. Consequently, the cumulative duration of combined therapy had a significant impact on the LRC (p = 0.005) and survival (p = 0.03) rates. A 2-week reduction in the PORT duration by using the concomitant boost technique did not increase the late treatment toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: This Phase III trial established the power of risk assessment using pathologic features in determining the need for, and dose of, PORT in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell cancer in a prospective, multi-institutional setting. It also revealed the impact of the overall treatment time in the combination of surgery and PORT on the outcome in high-risk patients and showed that PORT acceleration without a reduction in dose by a concomitant boost regimen did not increase the late complication rate. These findings emphasize the importance of coordinated interdisciplinary care in the delivery of combined surgery and RT.},

	abstract = {Hypersensitivity reactions of the oral mucosa comprise an array of clinical manifestations. Some of the reactions are difficult to differentiate from toxic reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions of type I, type III, and type IV are well known, although, especially for types I and III, they are rarely encountered. Type-I reactions are most frequently seen related to application of polymers in the oral cavity, such as orthodontic bonding and fissure sealant materials. There may also be systemic manifestations such as urticaria. Type-IV reactions may be seen related to most dental materials used, from amalgam and gold to polymers. These reactions appear as chronic reddening and/or ulceration of the oral mucosa. Lichenoid reactions have histopathological characteristics compatible with type-IV hypersensitivity reactions and are the most prevalent material-adverse reactions seen in the oral cavity. A special variety inside the lips with multiple papules and/or diffuse redness has recently been identified. This lesion comprises a serious treatment challenge. Skin patch tests, applying a series of dental materials in non-toxic concentrations on the skin, have been used to identify sensitization. However, the value of those tests can be questioned. Exacerbation of geographic stomatitis may be another form of hypersensitivity to dental materials.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the outcome of pharyngoesophageal reconstruction using radial forearm free flaps with regard to primary wound healing, speech, and swallowing in patients requiring laryngopharyngectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review in the setting of a tertiary, referral, and academic center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients underwent reconstruction of the pharyngoesophageal segment using fasciocutaneous radial forearm free flaps. RESULTS: All free flap transfers were successful. An oral diet was resumed in 85% of the patients after surgery. Postoperative pharyngocutaneous fistulas occurred in 4 patients (20%) with 3 resolving spontaneously. Distal strictures also occurred in 20% of the patients. Five patients who underwent tracheoesophageal puncture achieved useful speech. CONCLUSIONS: Advantages of radial forearm free flaps for microvascular pharyngoesophageal function include high flap reliability, limited donor site morbidity, larger vascular pedicle caliber, and the ability to achieve good quality tracheoesophageal speech. The swallowing outcome is similar to that achieved after jejunal flap pharyngoesophageal reconstruction. The main disadvantage of this technique relates to a moderately high incidence of pharyngocutaneous fistulas, which contributes to delayed oral intake in affected patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To report the final results of a prospective randomized trial that aimed to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of concomitant postoperative radiotherapy and Cisplatin infusion in patients with Stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and histological evidence of extracapsular spread of tumor in lymph node metastase(s). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Radiotherapy was delivered using a daily dose of 1.7 Gy for the first 54 Gy and 1.8 to 2 Gy until the completion of the treatment. Cisplatin 50 mg i.v. with forced hydratation was given or not every week (i.e., seven to nine cycles) concurrently with radiotherapy. A total of 44 patients were treated by irradiation only (RT group) and 39 by irradiation with chemotherapy (CM group). RESULTS: The RT group displayed a higher rate of loco-regional failures as compared to CM group (41 vs. 23%; p = 0.08). The overall survival, the survival corrected for deaths by intercurrent disease, and the disease-free survival were better in CM group as compared to RT group with statistically significant differences. Survival without loco-regional treatment failure was better in the CM group, the difference being close to the level of significance (p = 0.05). Survival without distant metastases were comparable in the two therapeutic groups. Ten severe late complications were observed, four in the RT group (17%) and six in the CM group (22%). Cox univariate analysis confirmed the importance of the therapeutic modality in predicting the overall survival, the survival corrected for deaths by intercurrent disease, and the disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: The present final report of this phase III study confirms preliminary results. The concomitant use of 50 mg weekly Cisplatin infusion and postoperative radiation improved loco-regional control and survival. No significant increase of late radiation complications was observed in the CM group.},

	abstract = {Alcohol consumption has been linked to an increased risk for various types of cancer. A combined analysis of more than 200 studies assessing the link between alcohol and various types of cancer (i.e., a meta-analysis) sought to investigate this association in more detail. This meta-analysis found that alcohol most strongly increased the risks for cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, and larynx. Statistically significant increases in risk also existed for cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, female breast, and ovaries. Several mechanisms have been postulated through which alcohol may contribute to an increased risk of cancer. Concurrent tobacco use, which is common among drinkers, enhances alcohol's effects on the risk for cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract. The analysis did not identify a threshold level of alcohol consumption below which no increased risk for cancer was evident.},

Their expression was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics as well as overall survival (OS), local progression-free survival (LPFS) and distant metastases free-survival (DMFS), also in the context of the HPV16-DNA/p16 status. After a median follow-up of 48 months (range: 4100 months), OS at 4 years was 46.5% for the entire cohort. In multivariate analysis, high CD8 expression was confirmed as an independent prognostic parameter for OS (p = 0.002), LPFS (p = 0.004) and DMFS (p = 0.006), while CD3 expression lacked significance. In multivariate analysis HPV16 DNA positivity was associated with improved OS (p = 0.025) and LPFS (p = 0.013) and p16-positive patients showed improved DMFS (p = 0.008). Interestingly, high CD8 expression was a prognostic parameter for the clinical outcome in both HPV16 DNA-positive and HPV16 DNA-negative patients. Similar findings were observed in the multivariate analysis for the combined HPV16 DNA/p16 status. Altogether, CD8+ TILs constitute an independent prognostic marker in SCCHN patients treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. These data indicate that CD8-positive TILs have antitumour activity and could be used for treatment stratification. Further validation of the prognostic value of CD8+ TILs as a biomarker and its role in the immune response in SCCHN patients after adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is warranted and will be performed in the prospective DKTK-ROG study.},

Postoperative radiotherapy decreases the recurrence rate in the neck, especially in cases with histologically established extranodal spread. Results of preoperative radiotherapy were similar to those of irradiation after surgery. Postoperative radiotherapy is favored, because it allows a selection of patients for extra treatment on the base of prognostic information, provided by the histologic characteristics of the neck dissection specimen.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): To examine the association between CD44 and c-MET expression in relation to p16 and EGFR in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). MATERIALS/METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining of CD44, p16, EGFR, and c-MET was performed on 105 locally advanced HNSCC patients treated with chemoradiation. CD44 expression was correlated with c-MET, EGFR, and p16, locoregional control (LRC), distant metastases (DM), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: High CD44 expression was present in 33% of patients and was associated with non-oropharynx primaries (P < 0.001), high c-MET expression (P < 0.001), p16-negative (P < 0.001) and EGFR-positive tumors (P < 0.001). Fifty-seven percent of CD44 high expressing tumors had high c-MET expression compared to 21% of CD44 low expressing tumors (P < 0.001). High CD44 expression predicted for worse LRC (HR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.16-5.13; P = 0.018), DFS (HR: 2.61; 95% CI: 1.46-4.67; P = 0.001), and OS (HR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.30-4.92; P = 0.007) but not DM (P = 0.57) on univariate analysis. Patients with both high CD44 and c-MET expression had a poor prognosis with a 2-year DFS of 30% compared to 70% in the rest of the cohort (P = 0.003). On multivariable analysis, after adjusting for site, T-stage, smoking history, and EGFR status, high c-MET (P = 0.039) and negative p16 status (P = 0.034) predicted for worse DFS, while high CD44 expression did not (P = 0.43). CONCLUSIONS: High CD44 expression is associated with high c-MET expression, p16-negative tumors, and EGFR-positive tumors. The combination of these markers predicts for poor prognosis in HNSCC patients treated with chemoradiation.},

New technologies allow isolation of cells expressing specific surface markers that are differentially expressed in tumour cell subpopulations that are enriched for cancer stem cells.

@article{RN163,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) often come to clinical attention with a neck mass due to metastatic spread to lymph nodes. Treatment is dictated by the subsequent determination of primary tumor site and stage. However, the primary site remains elusive in some patients even after an exhaustive examination. Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is an important etiologic agent for HNSCCs that arise within the oropharynx but less so for tumors from nonoropharyngeal sites. Detection of HPV-16 or a surrogate marker may be useful in localizing tumor origin in patients who present with metastatic HNSCC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed in situ hybridization (ISH) for HPV-16 on lymph node metastases from 68 patients with HNSCC. P16 immunohistochemistry was also performed because HPV-16 integration disrupts the retinoblastoma pathway and induces an overexpression of p16. RESULTS: HPV-16 was detected in 22 of the 68 (32%) cases by ISH. When stratified by site of origin, HPV-16 was detected in 22 of 31 (71%) metastases from the oropharynx, but in none of the 37 (0%) metastases from other sites (P < 0.001; Fisher's exact). P16 expression was associated with the presence of HPV-16 by ISH: 21 of 22 HPV-16 positive tumors exhibited p16 expression, whereas only 4 of the 46 HPV-16-negative tumors were p16 positive (95% versus 9%; P < 0.001; Fisher's exact). P16 expression in the node metastases also correlated with site of tumor origin: 24 of 31 oropharyngeal tumors were p16 positive, whereas only 1 of 37 nonoropharyngeal tumors was p16 positive (77% versus 3%; P < 0.001; Fisher's exact). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with metastatic HNSCC, detection of HPV-16 is a reliable way to establish origin from the oropharynx, either directly by ISH or indirectly by immunohistochemistry for p16 overexpression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2004, level I evidence was established for the postoperative adjuvant treatment of patients with selected high-risk locally advanced head and neck cancers, with the publication of the results of two trials conducted in Europe (European Organization Research and Treatment of Cancer; EORTC) and the United States (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group; RTOG). Adjuvant chemotherapy-enhanced radiation therapy (CERT) was shown to be more efficacious than postoperative radiotherapy for these tumors in terms of locoregional control and disease-free survival. However, additional studies were needed to identify precisely which patients were most suitable for such intense treatment. METHODS: Both studies compared the addition of concomitant relatively high doses of cisplatin (on days 1, 22, and 43) to radiotherapy vs radiotherapy alone given after surgery in patients with high-risk cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx. A comparative analysis of the selection criteria, clinical and pathologic risk factors, and treatment outcomes was carried out using data pooled from these two trials. RESULTS: Extracapsular extension (ECE) and/or microscopically involved surgical margins were the only risk factors for which the impact of CERT was significant in both trials. There was also a trend in favor of CERT in the group of patients who had stage III-IV disease, perineural infiltration, vascular embolisms, and/or clinically enlarged level IV-V lymph nodes secondary to tumors arising in the oral cavity or oropharynx. Patients who had two or more histopathologically involved lymph nodes without ECE as their only risk factor did not seem to benefit from the addition of chemotherapy in this analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Subject to the usual caveats of retrospective subgroup analysis, our data suggest that in locally advanced head and neck cancer, microscopically involved resection margins and extracapsular spread of tumor from neck nodes are the most significant prognostic factors for poor outcome.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We compared concomitant cisplatin and irradiation with radiotherapy alone as adjuvant treatment for stage III or IV head and neck cancer. METHODS: After undergoing surgery with curative intent, 167 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone (66 Gy over a period of 6 1/2 weeks) and 167 to receive the same radiotherapy regimen combined with 100 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body-surface area on days 1, 22, and 43 of the radiotherapy regimen. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 60 months, the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher in the combined-therapy group than in the group given radiotherapy alone (P=0.04 by the log-rank test; hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.99), with 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival of 47 percent and 36 percent, respectively. The overall survival rate was also significantly higher in the combined-therapy group than in the radiotherapy group (P=0.02 by the log-rank test; hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.95), with five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival of 53 percent and 40 percent, respectively. The cumulative incidence of local or regional relapses was significantly lower in the combined-therapy group (P=0.007). The estimated five-year cumulative incidence of local or regional relapses (considering death from other causes as a competing risk) was 31 percent after radiotherapy and 18 percent after combined therapy. Severe (grade 3 or higher) adverse effects were more frequent after combined therapy (41 percent) than after radiotherapy (21 percent, P=0.001); the types of severe mucosal adverse effects were similar in the two groups, as was the incidence of late adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative concurrent administration of high-dose cisplatin with radiotherapy is more efficacious than radiotherapy alone in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer and does not cause an undue number of late complications.},

	abstract = {A case-control study of oral and pharyngeal cancer conducted in four areas of the United States provided information on the tobacco and alcohol use of 1114 patients and 1268 population-based controls. Because of the large study size, it could be shown that the risks of these cancers among nondrinkers increased with amount smoked, and conversely that the risks among nonsmokers increased with the level of alcohol intake. Among consumers of both products, risks of oropharyngeal cancer tended to combine more in a multiplicative than additive fashion and were increased more than 35-fold among those who consumed two or more packs of cigarettes and more than four alcoholic drinks/day. Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking were separately implicated, although it was shown for the first time that risk was not as high among male lifelong filter cigarette smokers. Cessation of smoking was associated with a sharply reduced risk of this cancer, with no excess detected among those having quit for 10 or more years, suggesting that smoking affects primarily a late stage in the process of oropharyngeal carcinogenesis. The risks varied by type of alcoholic beverage, being higher among those consuming hard liquor or beer than wine. The relative risk patterns were generally similar among whites and blacks, and among males and females, and showed little difference when oral and pharyngeal cancers were analyzed separately. From calculations of attributable risk, we estimate that tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking combine to account for approximately three-fourths of all oral and pharyngeal cancers in the United States.},

	abstract = {The last 15 years has seen an explosion of interest in the cancer stem cell (CSC). Although it was initially believed that only a rare population of stem cells are able to undergo self-renewing divisions and differentiate to form all populations within a malignancy, a recent work has shown that these cells may not be as rare as thought first, at least in some malignancies. Improved experimental models are beginning to uncover a less rigid structure to CSC biology, in which the concepts of functional plasticity and clonal evolution must be incorporated into the traditional models. Slowly the genetic programmes and biological processes underlying stem cell biology are being elucidated, opening the door to the development of drugs targeting the CSC. The aim of ongoing research to understand CSCs is to develop novel stem cell-directed treatments, which will reduce therapy resistance, relapse and the toxicity associated with current, non-selective agents.},

@article{RN286,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous results from our phase 3 randomised trial showed that adding cetuximab to primary radiotherapy increased overall survival in patients with locoregionally advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LASCCHN) at 3 years. Here we report the 5-year survival data, and investigate the relation between cetuximab-induced rash and survival. METHODS: Patients with LASCCHN of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx with measurable disease were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either comprehensive head and neck radiotherapy alone for 6-7 weeks or radiotherapy plus weekly doses of cetuximab: 400 mg/m(2) initial dose, followed by seven weekly doses at 250 mg/m(2). Randomisation was done with an adaptive minimisation technique to balance assignments across stratification factors of Karnofsky performance score, T stage, N stage, and radiation fractionation. The trial was un-blinded. The primary endpoint was locoregional control, with a secondary endpoint of survival. Following discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration, the dataset was locked, except for queries to the sites about overall survival, before our previous report in 2006, so that an independent review could be done. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. Following completion of treatment, patients underwent physical examination and radiographic imaging every 4 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter. The trial is registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00004227. FINDINGS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy with (n=211) or without (n=213) cetuximab, and all patients were followed for survival. Updated median overall survival for patients treated with cetuximab and radiotherapy was 49.0 months (95% CI 32.8-69.5) versus 29.3 months (20.6-41.4) in the radiotherapy-alone group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.56-0.95; p=0.018). 5-year overall survival was 45.6% in the cetuximab-plus-radiotherapy group and 36.4% in the radiotherapy-alone group. Additionally, for the patients treated with cetuximab, overall survival was significantly improved in those who experienced an acneiform rash of at least grade 2 severity compared with patients with no rash or grade 1 rash (HR 0.49, 0.34-0.72; p=0.002). INTERPRETATION: For patients with LASCCHN, cetuximab plus radiotherapy significantly improves overall survival at 5 years compared with radiotherapy alone, confirming cetuximab plus radiotherapy as an important treatment option in this group of patients. Cetuximab-treated patients with prominent cetuximab-induced rash (grade 2 or above) have better survival than patients with no or grade 1 rash.

	abstract = {The German S3 guideline on diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of laryngeal cancer was developed in 2019 as part of the oncology guideline program of the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften, AWMF) of the German Cancer Society (Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft, DKG) and German Cancer Aid (Deutsche Krebshilfe, DKH), published under the leadership of the German Society for Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery. The guideline was funded by DKH as part of the oncology guideline program. Since guidelines are an important tool for quality assurance and quality management in oncology, they should be incorporated into everyday care in a targeted and sustainable manner. The guideline should generally fulfil the interdisciplinary character of early diagnosis, diagnostics, treatment, rehabilitation, and follow-up, with the aim of developing evidence- and consensus-based recommendations and statements for treatment of laryngeal cancer with the aim of organ preservation, but also show their limits. The main recommendations of the original text are summarized. The guideline is available as a long and a short version in the guideline program of the DKG ( https://www.leitlinienprogramm-onkologie.de/leitlinien/larynxkarzinom/ ) and also as an app ( https://www.leitlinienprogramm-onkologie.de/app/ ).},

	abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an entity with peculiar clinical and molecular characteristics, which mainly arises from the reticulated epithelium lining the crypts of the palatine tonsils and the base of the tongue. The only head and neck site with a definite etiological association between persistent high-risk (HR) HPV infection and development of SCC is the oropharynx. HPV-positive malignancies represent 5-20% of all HNSCCs and 40-90% of those arising from the oropharynx, with widely variable rates depending on the geographic area, population, relative prevalence of environment-related SCC and detection assay. HPV-16 is by far the most common HR HPV genotype detected in oropharyngeal SCC (OPSCC), and the only definitely carcinogenic genotype for the head and neck region. Patients with HPV-induced OPSCC are more likely to be middle-aged white men, non-smokers, non-drinkers or mild to moderate drinkers, with higher socioeconomic status and better performance status than subjects with HPV-unrelated SCC. HPV-induced HNSCCs are often described as non-keratinizing, poorly differentiated or basaloid carcinomas, and are diagnosed in earlier T-category with a trend for a more advanced N-category, with cystic degeneration, than the HPV-unrelated carcinomas. HPV positivity is associated with better response to treatment and modality-independent survival benefit. Treatment selection in HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinoma is becoming a critical issue, and although there is no evidence from randomized, controlled trials to support a treatment de-escalation in HPV-positive SCC, some investigators argue that intensive combined modality strategies may represent an overtreatment.},

	abstract = {The hypothesis that the Mediterranean diet has a beneficial role on the risk of cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract has been evaluated using data from three case-control studies conducted in Italy between 1992 and 2000. The first study included 598 cases with incident, histologically confirmed cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx and 1491 hospital controls admitted to the same network of hospitals as cases for acute, nonneoplastic diseases. The second one included 304 subjects with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and 743 controls. The third one included 460 laryngeal cancer cases and 1088 controls. A score summarizing eight of the major characteristics of the Mediterranean diet was used. Odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for increasing levels of this score were estimated using unconditional regression models, adjusted for age, sex, study center, years of education, tobacco consumption, body mass index, and total energy intake. For all cancers considered, a reduced risk was found for increasing levels of the Mediterranean score: the odds ratios for subjects with six or more Mediterranean characteristics, compared with those with less than three characteristics, were 0.40 (95% CI, 0.26-0.62) for oral and pharyngeal, 0.26 (95% CI, 0.13-0.51) for esophageal, and 0.23 (95% CI, 0.13-0.40) for laryngeal cancer. All of the estimates were consistent in strata of the major identified risk factors for these neoplasms. This study provides evidence that an a priori defined nutritional pattern, which includes several aspects of the Mediterranean diet, favorably affects the risk of cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several trials have studied the role of unconventional fractionated radiotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, but the effect of such treatment on survival is not clear. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess whether this type of radiotherapy could improve survival. METHODS: Randomised trials comparing conventional radiotherapy with hyperfractionated or accelerated radiotherapy, or both, in patients with non-metastatic HNSCC were identified and updated individual patient data were obtained. Overall survival was the main endpoint. Trials were grouped in three pre-specified categories: hyperfractionated, accelerated, and accelerated with total dose reduction. FINDINGS: 15 trials with 6515 patients were included. The median follow-up was 6 years. Tumours sites were mostly oropharynx and larynx; 5221 (74%) patients had stage III-IV disease (International Union Against Cancer, 1987). There was a significant survival benefit with altered fractionated radiotherapy, corresponding to an absolute benefit of 3.4% at 5 years (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.97; p=0.003). The benefit was significantly higher with hyperfractionated radiotherapy (8% at 5 years) than with accelerated radiotherapy (2% with accelerated fractionation without total dose reduction and 1.7% with total dose reduction at 5 years, p=0.02). There was a benefit on locoregional control in favour of altered fractionation versus conventional radiotherapy (6.4% at 5 years; p<0.0001), which was particularly efficient in reducing local failure, whereas the benefit on nodal control was less pronounced. The benefit was significantly higher in the youngest patients (hazard ratio 0.78 [0.65-0.94] for under 50 year olds, 0.95 [0.83-1.09] for 51-60 year olds, 0.92 [0.81-1.06] for 61-70 year olds, and 1.08 [0.89-1.30] for over 70 year olds; test for trends p=0.007). INTERPRETATION: Altered fractionated radiotherapy improves survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Comparison of the different types of altered radiotherapy suggests that hyperfractionation has the greatest benefit.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several trials have studied the role of unconventional fractionated radiotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, but the effect of such treatment on survival is not clear. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess whether this type of radiotherapy could improve survival. METHODS: Randomised trials comparing conventional radiotherapy with hyperfractionated or accelerated radiotherapy, or both, in patients with non-metastatic HNSCC were identified and updated individual patient data were obtained. Overall survival was the main endpoint. Trials were grouped in three pre-specified categories: hyperfractionated, accelerated, and accelerated with total dose reduction. FINDINGS: 15 trials with 6515 patients were included. The median follow-up was 6 years. Tumours sites were mostly oropharynx and larynx; 5221 (74%) patients had stage III-IV disease (International Union Against Cancer, 1987). There was a significant survival benefit with altered fractionated radiotherapy, corresponding to an absolute benefit of 3.4% at 5 years (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.97; p=0.003). The benefit was significantly higher with hyperfractionated radiotherapy (8% at 5 years) than with accelerated radiotherapy (2% with accelerated fractionation without total dose reduction and 1.7% with total dose reduction at 5 years, p=0.02). There was a benefit on locoregional control in favour of altered fractionation versus conventional radiotherapy (6.4% at 5 years; p<0.0001), which was particularly efficient in reducing local failure, whereas the benefit on nodal control was less pronounced. The benefit was significantly higher in the youngest patients (hazard ratio 0.78 [0.65-0.94] for under 50 year olds, 0.95 [0.83-1.09] for 51-60 year olds, 0.92 [0.81-1.06] for 61-70 year olds, and 1.08 [0.89-1.30] for over 70 year olds; test for trends p=0.007). INTERPRETATION: Altered fractionated radiotherapy improves survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Comparison of the different types of altered radiotherapy suggests that hyperfractionation has the greatest benefit.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcriptionally active high-risk human papilloma viruses (HPVs), particularly HPV type 16 (HPV16), are found in a subset of head and neck squamous-cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). HPV16-associated carcinogenesis is mediated by expression of the viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which cause deregulation of the cell cycle by inactivating p53 and pRb, respectively. We tested the hypothesis that HPV-associated HNSCCs display a pattern of genetic alterations different from those of HNSCCs without HPV DNA. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction-based assays were used to examine 143 consecutive HNSCCs (106 of the oral cavity and 37 of the oropharynx) for the presence of HPV DNA and for viral E6 and/or E7 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. The HPV DNA-and E6 and E7 mRNA-positive HNSCCs and an equal number of HPV DNA-negative HNSCCs were further analyzed for mutations in TP53, the gene encoding p53, and for allelic loss of 28 microsatellite markers at chromosome arms 3p, 6q, 8p, 9p, 13q, 17p, and 18q, including markers located in regions of chromosome arms 9p and 17p that harbor genes involved the p53 and pRb pathways. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Twenty-four (16.7%) of the 143 HNSCCs were positive for HPV16 DNA, and 12 of these HNSCCs (8.4% of total number) expressed E6 and E7 mRNAs. None of the HPV DNA-and E6/E7 mRNA-positive tumors had TP53 gene mutations, whereas nine (75%) of the 12 HPV DNA-negative tumors had such mutations (P<.001). Compared with the HPV DNA-negative HNSCCs, the E6/E7 mRNA-positive HNSCCs had statistically significantly lower levels of allelic loss for 13 of the 15 markers on 3p, 9p, and 17p. CONCLUSIONS: HNSCCs with transcriptionally active HPV16 DNA are characterized by occasional chromosomal loss, whereas HNSCCs lacking HPV DNA are characterized by gross deletions that involve whole or large parts of chromosomal arms and that already occur early in HNSCC development. These distinct patterns of genetic alterations suggest that HPV16 infection is an early event in HNSCC development.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Former meta-analyses have shown a survival benefit for the addition of chemotherapy (CHX) to radiotherapy (RT) and to some extent also for the use of hyperfractionated radiation therapy (HFRT) and accelerated radiation therapy (AFRT) in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. However, the publication of new studies and the fact that many older studies that were included in these former meta-analyses used obsolete radiation doses, CHX schedules or study designs prompted us to carry out a new analysis using strict inclusion criteria. METHODS: Randomised trials testing curatively intended RT (> or =60 Gy in >4 weeks/>50 Gy in <4 weeks) on SCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx published as full paper or in abstract form between 1975 and 2003 were eligible. Trials comparing RT alone with concurrent or alternating chemoradiation (5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, carboplatin, mitomycin C) were analyzed according to the employed radiation schedule and the used CHX regimen. Studies comparing conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) with either HFRT or AFRT without CHX were separately examined. End point of the meta-analysis was overall survival. RESULTS: Thirty-two trials with a total of 10 225 patients were included into the meta-analysis. An overall survival benefit of 12.0 months was observed for the addition of simultaneous CHX to either CFRT or HFRT/AFRT (p < 0.001). Separate analyses by cytostatic drug indicate a prolongation of survival of 24.0 months, 16.8 months, 6.7 months, and 4.0 months, respectively, for the simultaneous administration of 5-FU, cisplatin-based, carboplatin-based, and mitomycin C-based CHX to RT (each p < 0.01). Whereas no significant gain in overall survival was observed for AFRT in comparison to CFRT, a substantial prolongation of median survival (14.2 months, p < 0.001) was seen for HFRT compared to CFRT (both without CHX). CONCLUSION: RT combined with simultaneous 5-FU, cisplatin, carboplatin, and mitomycin C as single drug or combinations of 5-FU with one of the other drugs results in a large survival advantage irrespective the employed radiation schedule. If radiation therapy is used as single modality, hyperfractionation leads to a significant improvement of overall survival. Accelerated radiation therapy alone, especially when given as split course radiation schedule or extremely accelerated treatments with decreased total dose, does not increase overall survival.},

	abstract = {Head Neck Cancer of Unknown Primary (HNCUP) is a rare condition, representing approximately 5-10% of all head neck cancers. Radiotherapy, adjuvant or radical, is usually employed in the treatment of those patients. To date, no specific guidelines for the optimal definition of the target volume to be irradiated have been published. In recent years, there have been advances in the knowledge of the molecular biology of HNCUP, its diagnostic imaging and the implementation of sophisticated radiotherapy techniques with enhanced precision in target localization and treatment delivery. These progresses have provided valuable information about the natural history of HNCUP that will allow for establishment of the best treatment for each patient, including standardized, consistent and reproducible target volumes definitions. Several recommendations regarding how to choose volumes when contouring HNCUP in clinical practice are reported, in order to achieve a high rate of loco-regional control while avoiding unnecessary toxicity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We designed a randomized clinical trial to test whether the addition of three cycles of chemotherapy during standard radiation therapy would improve disease-free survival in patients with stages III and IV (i.e., advanced oropharynx carcinoma). METHODS: A total of 226 patients have been entered in a phase III multicenter, randomized trial comparing radiotherapy alone (arm A) with radiotherapy with concomitant chemotherapy (arm B). Radiotherapy was identical in the two arms, delivering, with conventional fractionation, 70 Gy in 35 fractions. In arm B, patients received during the period of radiotherapy three cycles of a 4-day regimen containing carboplatin (70 mg/m(2) per day) and 5-fluorouracil (600 mg/m(2) per day) by continuous infusion. The two arms were equally balanced with regard to age, sex, stage, performance status, histology, and primary tumor site. RESULTS: Radiotherapy compliance was similar in the two arms with respect to total dose, treatment duration, and treatment interruption. The rate of grades 3 and 4 mucositis was statistically significantly higher in arm B (71%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 54%-85%) than in arm A (39%; 95% CI = 29%-56%). Skin toxicity was not different between the two arms. Hematologic toxicity was higher in arm B as measured by neutrophil count and hemoglobin level. Three-year overall actuarial survival and disease-free survival rates were, respectively, 51% (95% CI = 39%-68%) versus 31% (95% CI = 18%-49%) and 42% (95% CI = 30%-57%) versus 20% (95% CI = 10%-33%) for patients treated with combined modality versus radiation therapy alone (P =.02 and.04, respectively). The locoregional control rate was improved in arm B (66%; 95% CI = 51%-78%) versus arm A (42%; 95% CI = 31%-56%). CONCLUSION: The statistically significant improvement in overall survival that was obtained supports the use of concomitant chemotherapy as an adjunct to radiotherapy in the management of carcinoma of the oropharynx.},

	abstract = {Despite recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of head and neck cancer, there has been little evidence of improvement in 5-year survival rates over the last few decades. To determine more accurate trends in site-specific outcomes as opposed to a more general overview of head and neck cancer patients, we analyzed the site-specific data collected in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-SEER Public-Use Database 1973-1999. Based on the selection criteria, 96,232 cases were evaluated for trend analysis in incidence, clinical stage, treatment and 5-year survival. During the period 1973-1999, site-specific incidence rates for head and neck cancer changed significantly. Site-specific analysis of survival from 1974-1997 showed significant improvements in 5-year survival rates for cancers of the nasopharynx, oropharynx and hypopharynx (38.1% to 56.7% for nasopharynx, p < 0.001; 36.3% to 49.1% for oropharynx, p = 0.001 and 28.3% to 33.3% for hypopharynx, p = 0.015). The prognosis for early-stage salivary gland cancer during 1983-1997 and late-stage larynx cancer during 1974-1997 also demonstrated improvement (82.7% to 88.5%, p = 0.012 and 22.2% to 38.3%, p = 0.013, respectively). On the other hand, the prognosis for regional stage oral cavity cancer as well as early-stage larynx cancer patients declined during 1983-1997 (49.2% to 43.8%, p = 0.032 and 82.3% to 74.3%, p = 0.002, respectively). Site-specific changes in treatment and staging were also noted. Site-specific analysis allows for a more accurate description of incidence, staging, treatment, and prognostic trends for head and neck cancer.},

@article{RN300,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Questions regarding the cell source and mechanisms in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer are today still open for debate. Indeed, our knowledge regarding prostate cell regulation, self-renewal, and cytodifferentiation is presently rather limited. In this study, we investigated these processes in the normal adult human prostate. METHODS: Dynamic expression patterns in prostate stem/progenitor cells, intermediate/transit-amplifying cells, and cell lineages were immunohistochemically identified in an in situ explant renewal model of the human normal/benign adult prostate (n=6). RESULTS: Cells with a basal phenotype proliferated significantly in explant cultures, whereas luminal cells went into apoptosis. Results further show down-regulation in tissue cultures of the basal and hypothetical stem cell marker Bcl-2 in the majority of cells, except in rare putative epithelial stem cells. Investigation of established (AC133) and novel candidate prostate stem/progenitor markers, including the cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase KIT and its ligand stem cell factor (SCF), showed that these rare epithelial cells are AC133(+)/CD133(low)/Bcl-2(high)/cytokeratin(+)/vimentin(-)/KIT(low)/SCF(low). In addition, we report on a stromal population that expresses the mesenchymal marker vimentin and that is AC133(-)/CD133(high)/Bcl-2(-)/cytokeratin(-)/KIT(high)/SCF(high). CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence for epithelial renewal in response to tissue culture and for basal and epithelial stem/progenitor cell recruitment leading to an expansion of an intermediate luminal precursor phenotype. Data further suggest that SCF regulates prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cells in an autocrine manner and that all or a subset of the identified novel stromal phenotype represents prostate stromal progenitor cells or interstitial pacemaker cells or both.},

	abstract = {Head and neck cancer (HNC) is one of the 10 most frequent cancers worldwide, with an estimated over 500,000 new cases being diagnosed annually. The overall 5-year survival rate in patients with HNC is one of the lowest among common malignant neoplasms and has not significantly changed during the last two decades. Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) shares part of HNC and has been reported to be increasing in the betel quid chewing area in recent years. During 2006, OSCC has become the sixth most common type of cancer in Taiwan, and it is also the fourth most common type of cancer among men. It follows that this type of cancer wreaks a high social and personal cost. Environmental carcinogens such as betel quid chewing, tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking have been identified as major risk factors for head and neck cancer. There is growing interest in understanding the relationship between genetic susceptibility and the prevalent environmental carcinogens for HNC prevention. Within this review, we discuss the molecular and cellular aspects of HNC carcinogenesis in Taiwan, an endemic betel quid chewing area. Knowledge of molecular carcinogenesis of HNC may provide critical clues for diagnosis, prognosis, individualization of therapy and molecular therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a prevalent cancer worldwide. Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling is reported to promote tumor malignancy and recurrence in HNSCC. Cucurbitacins, triterpenoid derivatives, are strong STAT3 inhibitors with anticancer properties. Recent studies have shown aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) to be a marker of cancer stem cells (CSC) in HNSCC. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of cucurbitacin I in HNSCC-derived CSCs. Using immunohistochemical analysis, we firstly showed that CD44, ALDH1, and phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) were higher in high-grade HNSCCs, and that triple positivity for CD44/ALDH1/p-STAT3 indicated a worse prognosis for HNSCC patients. Secondly, CD44(+)ALDH1(+) cells isolated from seven HNSCC patients showed greater tumorigenicity, radioresistance, and high expression of stemness (Bmi-1/Oct-4/Nanog) and epithelial-mesenchymal-transitional (Snail/Twist) genes as p-STAT3 level increased. Furthermore, we found that cucurbitacin I (JSI-124) can effectively inhibit the expression of p-STAT3 and capacities for tumorigenicity, sphere formation, and radioresistance in HNSCC-CD44(+)ALDH1(+). Notably, 150 nmol/L cucurbitacin I effectively blocked STAT3 signaling and downstream survivin and Bcl-2 expression, and it induced apoptosis in HNSCC-CD44(+)ALDH1(+). Moreover, microarray data indicated that 100 nmol/L cucurbitacin I facilitated CD44(+)ALDH1(+) cells to differentiate into CD44(-)ALDH1(-) and enhanced the radiosensitivity of HNSCC-CD44(+)ALDH1(+). Xenotransplant experiments revealed that cucurbitacin I combined with radiotherapy significantly suppressed tumorigenesis and lung metastasis and further improved the survival rate in HNSCC-CD44(+)ALDH1(+)-transplanted immunocompromised mice. Taken together, our data show that cucurbitacin I, STAT3 inhibitor, reduces radioresistant, distant-metastatic, and CSC-like properties of HNSCC-CD44(+)ALDH1(+) cells. The potential of cucurbitacin I as a radiosensitizer should be verified in future anti-CSC therapy.},

	abstract = {Soft-tissue defects of the mouth floor need thin, foldable, and pliable tissues able to preserve local anatomy as well as chewing, phonation, and deglutition. The oral mucosa is made of a stratified, nonkeratinized, epithelium-secreting mucus, which lubricates the oral cavity and facilitates tongue movements. No flap exists that can reproduce the physiology of the oral mucosa better than the oral mucosa itself. Prefabrication of mucosal flaps may represent the best solution. Therefore, 10 consecutive cases of mouth floor cancer were treated with prelamination of the fascia antibrachialis with mucosal grafts obtained from the healthy cheek, and with subsequent transplantation 3 weeks later. A significant increase in mucosal graft surface was seen in all cases, with a mean size twice the original. All flaps healed uneventfully. Follow-up time ranged between 2-60 months (average, 26.6 months). Morphological and functional results were excellent. Tongue motility, speech intelligibility, and swallowing were reestablished in all treated cases. Mucosal prelamination of the forearm fascia is feasible and allows physiological reconstruction of oral cavity defects up to 6 x 4 cm.},

	abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer with an annual incidence of approximately 400,000 worldwide. Although the principal risk factors for head and neck cancer remain tobacco and alcohol use, human papillomavirus (HPV) has recently been found to be etiologically associated with 20 to 25% of HNSCC, mostly in the oropharynx. HPV causes human cancers by expressing two viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7. These oncoproteins degrade and destabilize two major tumor suppressor proteins, p53 and pRb, through ubiquitination. Additional studies have shown that E6 and E7 can directly bind to multiple host proteins other than p53 and pRb (e.g., Bak and p21(Cip1)), further contributing to genetic instability. However, expression of E6 and E7 alone is not sufficient for cellular transformation, and the additional genetic alterations necessary for malignant progression in the setting of virus-induced genomic instability are unknown. In addition to the etiological differences, HPV-positive cancers are clinically distinct when compared with HPV-negative cancers with regard to treatment response and survival outcome, with tumor HPV-positivity being a favorable prognostic biomarker. Further understanding of carcinogenesis and clinical behavior of HPV-positive cancers will improve disease prevention, patient care, and surveillance strategies for HNSCC patients.},

	abstract = {Despite a wealth of experimental data, the precise mechanisms governing the maintenance and regeneration of the intestine remain relatively poorly elucidated. After physical or genetic injury, stem cells from the intestinal crypt are killed and the subsequent repopulation process recruits new stem cells from sources currently unknown. Understanding the genetic elements that determine stem cell fate and the basis by which repopulation occurs will greatly aid our understanding of both stem cell plasticity and the contribution made by the stem cell compartment to malignant disease. It would also provide a better platform to develop therapies to regenerate damaged intestinal epithelia as seen after radiation injuries or inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease. In this review we discuss some of the basic mechanisms that regulate intestinal stem cell viability and maintenance, and also summarise recent data from our laboratory on the requirement for the Wnt pathway in these processes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In accord with the cancer stem cell (CSC) theory, only a small subset of cancer cells are capable of forming tumors. We previously reported that CD44 isolates tumorigenic cells from head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Recent studies indicate that aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity may represent a more specific marker of CSCs. METHODS: Six primary HNSCCs were collected. Cells with high and low ALDH activity (ALDH(high)/ALDH(low)) were isolated. ALDH(high) and ALDH(low) populations were implanted into NOD/SCID mice and monitored for tumor development. RESULTS: ALDH(high) cells represented a small percentage of the tumor cells (1% to 7.8%). ALDH(high) cells formed tumors from as few as 500 cells in 24/45 implantations, whereas only 3/37 implantations of ALDH(low) cells formed tumors. CONCLUSIONS: ALDH(high) cells comprise a subpopulation cells in HNSCCs that are tumorigenic and capable of producing tumors at very low numbers. This finding indicates that ALDH activity on its own is a highly selective marker for CSCs in HNSCC.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract the presence or absence of neck metastases is the most important prognostic factor. This makes the histopathologic assessment of neck dissections of paramount importance. With the clinically N0 neck the prevalence of microscopic extracapsular spread and soft tissue deposits has not previously been described. METHODS: We have prospectively analyzed 96 elective neck dissections in 63 patients with upper aerodigestive tract squamous cell carcinoma and clinically N0 necks to assess the prevalence of microscopic extracapsular spread and soft tissue deposits. The dissections were separated peroperatively into nodal levels; these were sectioned at 6-microm sections and stained with H & E. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (30.2%) were upstaged to pN+ve. Twelve of these had microscopic extracapsular spread, which was 19.0% of the clinically N0 necks and 63.2% of the pN+ve. Five had soft tissue deposits, which was 7.9% of the clinically N0 necks. Fourteen patients had microscopic extracapsular spread and/or soft tissue deposits, which represented 22.2% of all necks examined and 73.7% of the pN+ve necks. CONCLUSIONS: Microscopic extracapsular spread and soft tissue deposits have a high prevalence in patients with clinically N0 necks. Extracapsular spread can occur at an early stage in metastasis from upper aerodigestive tract squamous cell carcinoma. Soft tissue deposits can also occur at an early stage. Soft tissue deposits may occur by the same process as lymph node metastasis with total effacement of the lymph node or may occur by some other process such as lymphatic tumor embolization.},

@article{RN219,
	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The goals of this article are: to briefly review oropharyngeal anatomy; to provide a review of the epidemiology of oropharyngeal cancer in the Western Hemisphere; to review the literature on the association of human papilloma virus with oropharyngeal cancer; to review the recent literature on evolving diagnostic techniques for oropharyngeal cancer; and to summarize accepted management strategies for oropharyngeal cancer by subsite. RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of oropharyngeal cancer may be increasing among younger age groups in the Western Hemisphere, and this may be related to an increased association with human papillomavirus 16. The implications of this viral association with regard to outcomes and management strategies remain under investigation. Screening with toluidine blue, autofluorescence, or both may be useful adjuncts to physical examination and panendoscopy in assessing potentially invasive or dysplastic lesions of the oropharynx. These techniques remain under study. MRI and PET scan are proving to be useful techniques for assessing local extension, regional metastases, and recurrences of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oropharynx in selected cases. However, serial computed tomography scanning remains the imaging modality of choice in the United States. Early SCCs of the oropharynx (T1-2), in general, may be managed effectively with either surgery or primary irradiation, though, with either technique, clinicians must have a management plan for the neck. Advanced SCCs of the oropharynx (T3-4, nodally aggressive, or both) require multimodal approaches consisting of either surgery along with adjuvant irradiation or concurrent chemoradiation along with salvage surgery (as necessary). SUMMARY: Management of SCC of the oropharynx is in a period of transition because of evolving changes in our understanding of the oncogenic process; evolving diagnostic techniques; and evolving combinations of therapies, both surgical and nonsurgical. For the time being, we propose using local subsite and disease stage to guide therapeutic decision-making.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the use of resection and postoperative radiotherapy, high-risk squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck frequently recurs in the original tumor bed. We tested the hypothesis that concurrent postoperative administration of cisplatin and radiotherapy would improve the rate of local and regional control. METHODS: Between September 9, 1995, and April 28, 2000, 459 patients were enrolled. After undergoing total resection of all visible and palpable disease, 231 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone (60 to 66 Gy in 30 to 33 fractions over a period of 6 to 6.6 weeks) and 228 patients to receive the identical treatment plus concurrent cisplatin (100 mg per square meter of body-surface area intravenously on days 1, 22, and 43). RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 45.9 months, the rate of local and regional control was significantly higher in the combined-therapy group than in the group given radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for local or regional recurrence, 0.61; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.41 to 0.91; P=0.01). The estimated two-year rate of local and regional control was 82 percent in the combined-therapy group, as compared with 72 percent in the radiotherapy group. Disease-free survival was significantly longer in the combined-therapy group than in the radiotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease or death, 0.78; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.99; P=0.04), but overall survival was not (hazard ratio for death, 0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.09; P=0.19). The incidence of acute adverse effects of grade 3 or greater was 34 percent in the radiotherapy group and 77 percent in the combined-therapy group (P<0.001). Four patients who received combined therapy died as a direct result of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Among high-risk patients with resected head and neck cancer, concurrent postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy significantly improve the rates of local and regional control and disease-free survival. However, the combined treatment is associated with a substantial increase in adverse effects.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Previous analysis of this Intergroup trial demonstrated that with a median follow-up among surviving patients of 45.9 months, the concurrent postoperative administration of cisplatin and radiation therapy improved local-regional control and disease-free survival of patients who had high-risk resectable head-and-neck carcinomas. With a minimum of 10 years of follow-up potentially now available for all patients, these results are updated here to examine long-term outcomes. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 410 analyzable patients who had high-risk resected head-and-neck cancers were prospectively randomized to receive either radiation therapy (RT: 60 Gy in 6 weeks) or identical RT plus cisplatin, 100 mg/m(2)i.v. on days 1, 22, and 43 (RT + CT). RESULTS: At 10 years, the local-regional failure rates were 28.8% vs 22.3% (P=.10), disease-free survival was 19.1% vs 20.1% (P=.25), and overall survival was 27.0% vs 29.1% (P=.31) for patients treated by RT vs RT + CT, respectively. In the unplanned subset analysis limited to patients who had microscopically involved resection margins and/or extracapsular spread of disease, local-regional failure occurred in 33.1% vs 21.0% (P=.02), disease-free survival was 12.3% vs 18.4% (P=.05), and overall survival was 19.6% vs 27.1% (P=.07), respectively. CONCLUSION: At a median follow-up of 9.4 years for surviving patients, no significant differences in outcome were observed in the analysis of all randomized eligible patients. However, analysis of the subgroup of patients who had either microscopically involved resection margins and/or extracapsular spread of disease showed improved local-regional control and disease-free survival with concurrent administration of chemotherapy. The remaining subgroup of patients who were enrolled only because they had tumor in 2 or more lymph nodes did not benefit from the addition of CT to RT.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Twenty-five percent of squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck are not related to tobacco or alcohol consumption. The risk factors for this group of malignancies are not very well established yet. HNSCCNAT are more likely to occur in the oropharynx. The diagnosis is more frequent at young age (before 50). The prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV-positive) infection is high. SUMMARY: Monitoring HPV status in head and neck cancer patients who are not tobacco or alcohol consumers will enable physicians to better plan treatment.},

We investigated whether sexual behaviors that elevated the odds of oropharyngeal cancer developing in a case-control study similarly elevated the odds of oral HPV infection developing among control patients. HPV infection was detected in 4.8% of 332 control patients from an outpatient clinic and in 2.9% of 210 college-aged men (age range, 18-23 years). Among control patients, the odds of infection developing independently increased with increases in the lifetime number of oral (P = .007, for trend) or vaginal sex partners (P = .003, for trend). Among college-aged men, the odds of oral HPV infection developing increased with increases in the number of recent oral sex partners (P = .046, for trend) or open-mouthed kissing partners (P = .023, for trend) but not vaginal sex partners. Oral sex and open-mouthed kissing are associated with the development of oral HPV infection.},

	abstract = {Recent observations indicate that, in several types of human cancer, only a phenotypic subset of cancer cells within each tumor is capable of initiating tumor growth. This functional subset of cancer cells is operationally defined as the "cancer stem cell" (CSC) subset. Here we developed a CSC model for the study of human colorectal cancer (CRC). Solid CRC tissues, either primary tissues collected from surgical specimens or xenografts established in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice, were disaggregated into single-cell suspensions and analyzed by flow cytometry. Surface markers that displayed intratumor heterogeneous expression among epithelial cancer cells were selected for cell sorting and tumorigenicity experiments. Individual phenotypic cancer cell subsets were purified, and their tumor-initiating properties were investigated by injection in NOD/SCID mice. Our observations indicate that, in six of six human CRC tested, the ability to engraft in vivo in immunodeficient mice was restricted to a minority subpopulation of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)(high)/CD44+ epithelial cells. Tumors originated from EpCAM(high)/CD44+ cells maintained a differentiated phenotype and reproduced the full morphologic and phenotypic heterogeneity of their parental lesions. Analysis of the surface molecule repertoire of EpCAM(high)/CD44+ cells led to the identification of CD166 as an additional differentially expressed marker, useful for CSC isolation in three of three CRC tested. These results validate the stem cell working model in human CRC and provide a highly robust surface marker profile for CRC stem cell isolation.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To find molecular markers from expression profiling data to predict recurrence of laryngeal cancer after radiotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated gene expression data on pre-treatment biopsies from 52 larynx cancer patients. Patients developing a local recurrence were matched for T-stage, subsite, treatment, gender and age with non-recurrence patients. Candidate genes were then tested by immunohistochemistry on tumor material from a second series of 76 patients. Both series comprised early stage cancer treated with radiotherapy alone. Finally, gene expression data of eight larynx cancer cell lines with known radiosensitivity were analyzed. RESULTS: Nineteen patients with a local recurrence were matched with 33 controls. Gene sets for hypoxia, proliferation and intrinsic radiosensitivity did not correlate with recurrence, whereas expression of the putative stem cell marker CD44 did. In a supervised analysis, probes for all three splice variants of CD44 on the array appeared in the top 10 most significantly correlated with local recurrence. Immunohistochemical analysis of CD44 expression on the independent validation series confirmed CD44's predictive potential. In 8 larynx cancer cell lines, CD44 gene expression did not correlate with intrinsic radiosensitivity although it did correlate significantly with plating efficiency, consistent with a relationship with stem cell content. CONCLUSIONS: CD44 was the only biological factor tested which significantly correlated with response to radiotherapy in early stage larynx cancer patients, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Further studies are needed to confirm this and to assess how general these findings are for other head and neck tumor stages and sites.},

	abstract = {In 210 cases of oral cancer, 38 (17.6%) second primary tumours were found. Males had a higher chance of developing a second primary than females (21.4% versus 12%). The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.11). When the index tumour was in the lower part of the oral cavity (floor of mouth, retromolar trigone, inferior alveolar process), a higher rate of second primaries was found than in cancer of the rest of the oral cavity (tongue, buccal mucosa and palate) (26.6% versus 11.5%). In male patients, this difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). 4 tumours were synchronous. In those 4 patients, panendoscopy would not have contributed to an earlier diagnosis. Routine panendoscopy in oral cancer therefore seems not valid.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Intraoperative frozen section analysis of surgical margins is widely used in head and neck cancer surgery. This study evaluates frozen section accuracy relative to permanent controls and final margins from the entire specimen, the rate at which frozen sections impact intraoperative management, and the resultant cost. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective. METHODS: From 1997 to 1999 the frozen section results, permanent controls, and final tumor margins from 80 consecutive patients undergoing 420 intraoperative frozen section margins for head and neck malignancy were reviewed. RESULTS: A 98.3% accuracy rate (sensitivity, 88.8%; specificity, 98.9%) was found compared with permanent sections of the same tissue. However, 40% (8 of 20) of patients with positive final margins on the resection specimen, and 100% (15 of 15) with close (<5 mm) margins were not detected by frozen section analysis. The overall accuracy of frozen section in the evaluation of close or positive final margins was 71.3% (sensitivity, 34.3%; specificity, 100%). In addition, 5% (4 of 80) of patients potentially benefited from intraoperative frozen section by virtue of immediate margin revision. The estimated cost of intraoperative frozen section averaged as much as $3,123 per patient, with a cost-benefit ratio of 20:1. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative frozen section margins are accurate, but they are costly and cannot reliably eradicate positive final margins. Patients with early-stage lesions and those undergoing re-resection for recurrence or salvage surgery after radiation failure derived the greatest potential benefit from frozen section margins.},

	abstract = {A new transgenic mouse has been generated in which the proto-oncogene BCL-2 is ubiquitously overexpressed. H2K-BCL-2 transgenic mice overexpress BCL-2 in all cells of the hematolymphoid system and have been used to assess the role of BCL-2 in protecting cells of the hematolymphoid system from the consequences of ionizing radiation. We have expanded on previous studies that have demonstrated protection for specific (lymphoid) cell populations and show that systemic overexpression of BCL-2 can protect the hematopoietic system as a whole, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), thus increasing the radioresistance of the animal. The increase in radioresistance in H2K-BCL-2 transgenic mice has two components: an increase in the radioresistance of individual cells and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the size of certain critically important cell populations, such as HSC. Bone marrow transplantation experiments show that the increased radioresistance of the transgenic animals is provided by cells of the hematopoietic system. Protection against the consequences of irradiation is not limited to the increased expression levels of BCL-2 in transgenic mice; levels of endogenous BCL-2 are higher in lymphocyte populations that survive irradiation in wild-type mice. We show that ubiquitous overexpression of BCL-2 in the hematopoietic system can be used to increase the resistance of animals to lethal challenges such as irradiation.},

@article{RN306,
	abstract = {In an increasing number of cancers, tumor populations called cancer stem cells (CSCs), or tumor-initiating cells, have been defined in functional assays of self-renewal and tumor initiation. Moreover, recent work in several different cancers has suggested the CSC population as a source of chemotherapy and radiation-therapy resistance within tumors. Work in glioblastoma and breast cancers supports the idea that CSCs may possess innate resistance mechanisms against radiation- and chemotherapy-induced cancer cell death, allowing them to survive and initiate tumor recurrence. Several resistance mechanisms have been proposed, including amplified checkpoint activation and DNA damage repair as well as increased Wnt/beta-catenin and Notch signaling. Novel targeted therapies against the DNA damage checkpoint or stem-cell maintenance pathways may sensitize CSCs to radiation or other therapies. Another important category of cancer therapies are antiangiogenic and vascular targeting agents, which are also becoming integrated in the treatment paradigm of an increasing number of cancers. Recent results from our laboratory and others support a role for CSCs in the angiogenic drive as well as the mechanism of antiangiogenic agents. Identifying and targeting the molecular mechanisms responsible for CSC therapeutic resistance may improve the efficacy of current cancer therapies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The improved prognosis for patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) relative to HPV-negative HNSCC observed in retrospective analyses remains to be confirmed in a prospective clinical trial. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the association of tumor HPV status with therapeutic response and survival among 96 patients with stage III or IV HNSCC of the oropharynx or larynx who participated in an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) phase II trial and who received two cycles of induction chemotherapy with intravenous paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by concomitant weekly intravenous paclitaxel and standard fractionation radiation therapy. The presence or absence of HPV oncogenic types in tumors was determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization. Two-year overall and progression-free survival for HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The relative hazard of mortality and progression for HPV-positive vs HPV-negative patients after adjustment for age, ECOG performance status, stage, and other covariables was estimated by use of a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Genomic DNA of oncogenic HPV types 16, 33, or 35 was located within tumor cell nuclei of 40% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 30% to 50%) of patients with HNSCC of the oropharynx or larynx by in situ hybridization and PCR. Compared with patients with HPV-negative tumors, patients with HPV-positive tumors had higher response rates after induction chemotherapy (82% vs 55%, difference = 27%, 95% CI = 9.3% to 44.7%, P = .01) and after chemoradiation treatment (84% vs 57%, difference = 27%, 95% CI = 9.7% to 44.3%, P = .007). After a median follow-up of 39.1 months, patients with HPV-positive tumors had improved overall survival (2-year overall survival = 95% [95% CI = 87% to 100%] vs 62% [95% CI = 49% to 74%], difference = 33%, 95% CI = 18.6% to 47.4%, P = .005, log-rank test) and, after adjustment for age, tumor stage, and ECOG performance status, lower risks of progression (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.75), and death from any cause (HR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.15 to 0.85) than those with HPV-negative tumors. CONCLUSION: For patients with HNSCC of the oropharynx, tumor HPV status is strongly associated with therapeutic response and survival.},

This paper reviews the sources and methods used in compiling the cancer statistics in 185 countries. The validity of the national estimates depends upon the representativeness of the source information, and to take into account possible sources of bias, uncertainty intervals are now provided for the estimated sex- and site-specific all-ages number of new cancer cases and cancer deaths. We briefly describe the key results globally and by world region. There were an estimated 18.1 million (95% UI: 17.5-18.7 million) new cases of cancer (17 million excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million (95% UI: 9.3-9.8 million) deaths from cancer (9.5 million excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) worldwide in 2018.},

@article{RN194,
	abstract = {The incidence of distant metastases in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is relatively small in comparison to other malignancies. Distant metastases adversely impact survival and may significantly affect treatment planning. The incidence of distant metastases is influenced by location of the primary tumor, initial T and N stage of the neoplasm, and the presence or absence of regional control above the clavicle. Patients with advanced nodal disease have a high incidence of distant metastases, particularly in the presence of jugular vein invasion or extensive soft tissue disease in the neck. Primary tumors of advanced T stages in the hypopharynx, oropharynx and oral cavity are associated with the highest incidence of distant metastases. Pulmonary metastases are the most frequent in SCC, accounting for 66% of distant metastases. It may be difficult to distinguish pulmonary metastasis from a new primary tumor, particularly if solitary. Other metastatic sites include bone (22%), liver (10%), skin, mediastinum and bone marrow. An important question remains as to how intensely pre- and postoperative screening for distant metastases should be performed. Preoperative chest X-ray is warranted in all cases. If the primary tumor and nodal status place the patient at high risk for pulmonary metastasis, then preoperative computed tomography scan of the chest should be done. Screening for distant metastases at other sites is usually not indicated in SCC of the upper aerodigestive tract. Postoperatively, annual X-rays of the chest are usually sufficient, but in high-risk situations a chest X-ray performed every 3-6 months may be beneficial. Certain histologic types of primary tumor have greater or lesser propensity to metastasize distantly, and have a different natural history. Adenoid cystic carcinoma metastasizes frequently, even in the absence of extensive local or regional disease. Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinomas also metastasize widely. Extensive evaluation for distant metastases is justified for these tumors. Knowledge of the natural history of various neoplasms and the factors that contribute to distant metastases as well as good judgement are essential for cost-effective treatment planning and decision-making with regard to pre- and postoperative evaluation for distant metastases in cancer of the head and neck.},

Postoperatively radiochemotherapy (RCT) with cis-Platin (CDDP)/5-FU versus radiotherapy (RT) alone was compared in a randomized trial. Methods: Between 5/97 and 12/04, 440 patients who had high-risk SCCAs of the head and neck were enrolled in this prospectively randomized phase III trial. Following resection and neck dissection, 214 patients were randomly assigned to RT (66 Gy/33 Fx/6.6 weeks) and 226 patients to identical RT plus CDDP (20 mg/m2 on day 1--5, 29--33) and 5-FU (600 mg/m2 on day 1--5, 29--33). Results: The 5 year local-regional control rate is 72.2 $\pm$ 3.7% following RT and 88.6 $\pm$ 2.4% for the RCT group (p = 0.00259; 5-year progression free survival 50.1 $\pm$ 4.0% and 62.4 $\pm$ 4.4% (p = 0.024) and 5-year overall survival 48.6 $\pm$ 4.4% vs. 58.1 $\pm$ 4.6% (p = 0.11). There was no difference in the 5 year incidence of distant metastases (19.3 $\pm$ 3.6% vs 25.5 $\pm$ 4.6%; p = 0.45).

	abstract = {PURPOSE: High histologic grade is usually associated with a greater propensity to distant metastases (DM). Its role to predict DM in head and neck cancer is not yet defined. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of histologic grade as an independent predictor of DM and to determine a subgroup of patients who may benefit from systemic chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 1,266 consecutive patients treated by definitive or postoperative radiotherapy between 1989 and 1997. All patients received at least 50 Gy. All stages and subsites of head/neck were included. DM rates were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method with a subsequent Cox analysis. RESULTS: There is a strong correlation of grade with N stage (P <.000001). The metastases-free survival (MFS) was 98%, 90%, and 72% for grades 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P <.000001). In patients with N0 stage, MFS is always greater than 90%, whatever the grade. In the 222 N1 patients, MFS was more than 90% in grade 1 and 2 but dropped to 75% for grade 3 (P =.001). In patients with N2 and N3, MFS was 91%, 79%, and 59% for grades 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P =.008). The same conclusion is applicable when only patients with neck control are analyzed. In a Cox model, grade was an independent predictor of DM (P =.000001) as well as T stage (P =.003), N stage (P =.000001), and neck failure (P =.0003). Higher grade was also an independent predictor of survival (P =.02). CONCLUSION: Patients with histologic grade 1 and grade 2 (except N3) are at low risk of DM. Patients with grade 2 and N3 or patients with grade 3 and N1 to N3 have a higher risk of distant metastases and should be considered for systemic treatment.},

Odds ratios for current smokers of cigarettes were 11.1 for oral cavity, 12.9 for pharynx, 4.6 for larynx, and 3.8 for esophagus. For all 4 sites, the risk increased with increasing number of cigarettes and duration of smoking habits and, with the exception of esophageal cancer, decreased with increasing age at the start of and years since quitting smoking. Smokers of pipes and cigars showed a more elevated risk of cancer of the oral cavity and esophagus than did cigarette smokers.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The optimal fractionation schedule for radiotherapy of head and neck cancer has been controversial. The objective of this randomized trial was to test the efficacy of hyperfractionation and two types of accelerated fractionation individually against standard fractionation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy delivered with: 1) standard fractionation at 2 Gy/fraction/day, 5 days/week, to 70 Gy/35 fractions/7 weeks; 2) hyperfractionation at 1. 2 Gy/fraction, twice daily, 5 days/week to 81.6 Gy/68 fractions/7 weeks; 3) accelerated fractionation with split at 1.6 Gy/fraction, twice daily, 5 days/week, to 67.2 Gy/42 fractions/6 weeks including a 2-week rest after 38.4 Gy; or 4) accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost at 1.8 Gy/fraction/day, 5 days/week and 1.5 Gy/fraction/day to a boost field as a second daily treatment for the last 12 treatment days to 72 Gy/42 fractions/6 weeks. Of the 1113 patients entered, 1073 patients were analyzable for outcome. The median follow-up was 23 months for all analyzable patients and 41.2 months for patients alive. RESULTS: Patients treated with hyperfractionation and accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost had significantly better local-regional control (p = 0.045 and p = 0.050 respectively) than those treated with standard fractionation. There was also a trend toward improved disease-free survival (p = 0.067 and p = 0.054 respectively) although the difference in overall survival was not significant. Patients treated with accelerated fractionation with split had similar outcome to those treated with standard fractionation. All three altered fractionation groups had significantly greater acute side effects compared to standard fractionation. However, there was no significant increase of late effects. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperfractionation and accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost are more efficacious than standard fractionation for locally advanced head and neck cancer. Acute but not late effects are also increased.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess clinical outcomes and patterns of loco-regional failure (LRF) in relation to clinical target volumes (CTV) in patients with locally advanced hypopharyngeal and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HL-SCC) treated with definitive intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and concurrent systemic therapy. METHODS: Data from HL-SCC patients treated from 2007 to 2010 were retrospectively evaluated. Primary endpoint was loco-regional control (LRC). Secondary endpoints included local (LC) and regional (RC) controls, distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), laryngectomy free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS), and acute and late toxicities. Time-to-event endpoints were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards models. Recurrent gross tumor volume (RTV) on post-treatment diagnostic imaging was analyzed in relation to corresponding CTV (in-volume, > 95% of RTV inside CTV; marginal, 20-95% inside CTV; out-volume, < 20% inside CTV). RESULTS: Fifty patients (stage III: 14, IVa: 33, IVb: 3) completed treatment and were included in the analysis (median follow-up of 4.2 years). Three-year LRC, DMFS and overall survival (OS) were 77%, 96% and 63%, respectively. Grade 2 and 3 acute toxicity were 38% and 62%, respectively; grade 2 and 3 late toxicity were 23% and 15%, respectively. We identified 10 patients with LRF (8 local, 1 regional, 1 local + regional). Six out of 10 RTVs were fully included in both elective and high-dose CTVs, and 4 RTVs were marginal to the high-dose CTVs. CONCLUSION: The treatment of locally advanced HL-SCC with definitive IMRT and concurrent systemic therapy provides good LRC rates with acceptable toxicity profile. Nevertheless, the analysis of LRFs in relation to CTVs showed in-volume relapses to be the major mode of recurrence indicating that novel strategies to overcome radioresistance are required.},

	abstract = {Oral cancer incidence rates rose dramatically during the twentieth century in the United States and Europe, especially among individuals under the age of 60 years. Although influenced by age, sex, and country of origin, incidence trends were most strongly affected by elevated risk among individuals born after approximately 1915. This cohort effect was indicative of strong behavioral influences on oral cancer risk. In this article, associations between oral cancer risk and established behavioral risk factors including alcohol and tobacco use are reviewed. Additionally, possible associations between oral cancer risk and oral hygiene, diet, nutritional status, and sexual behavior as well as the influence of genetic factors on oral cancer risk are considered. Special emphasis is placed on evaluating possible risk differences in individuals above and below the age of 45 and in users and nonusers of alcohol and tobacco.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV), including HPV-16, cause a subgroup of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). We examined whether the risk factors for HPV-16-positive HNSCCs are similar to those for HPV-16-negative HNSCCs in a hospital-based case-control study. METHODS: Case subjects (n = 240) diagnosed with HNSCC at the Johns Hopkins Hospital from 2000 through 2006 were stratified by tumor HPV-16 status as determined by in situ hybridization. Two control subjects (n = 322) without cancer were individually matched by age and sex to each HPV-16-positive and HPV-16-negative case subject. Data on risk behaviors were obtained by use of audio computer-assisted self-interview technology. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for HPV-16-positive HNSCC and HPV-16-negative HNSCC associated with risk factors. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: HPV-16 was detected in 92 of 240 case subjects. HPV-16-positive HNSCC was independently associated with several measures of sexual behavior and exposure to marijuana but not with cumulative measures of tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, or poor oral hygiene. Associations increased in strength with increasing number of oral sex partners (P(trend) = .01) and with increasing intensity (joints per month, P(trend) = .007), duration (in years, P(trend) = .01), and cumulative joint-years (P(trend) = .003) of marijuana use. By contrast, HPV-16-negative HNSCC was associated with measures of tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and poor oral hygiene but not with any measure of sexual behavior or marijuana use. Associations increased in strength with increasing intensity (cigarettes per day), duration, and cumulative pack-years of tobacco smoking (for all, P(trend) < .001), increasing years of heavy alcohol drinking (> or = 15 years of 14 drinks per week; P(trend) = .03), and increasing number of lost teeth (P(trend) = .001). Compared with subjects who neither smoked tobacco nor drank alcohol, those with heavy use of tobacco (> or = 20 pack-years) and alcohol had an increased risk of HPV-16-negative HNSCC (OR = 4.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8 to 12) but not of HPV-16-positive HNSCC (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.29 to 1.9). CONCLUSIONS: HPV-16-positive HNSCCs and HPV-16-negative HNSCCs have different risk factor profiles, indicating that they should be considered to be distinct cancers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are etiologic agents for anogenital tract cancers and have been detected in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). We investigated, retrospectively, an etiologic role for HPVs in a large series of patients with HNSCC. METHODS: Tumor tissues from 253 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent HNSCC were tested for the presence of HPV genome by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays, Southern blot hybridization, and in situ hybridization. The viral E6 coding region was sequenced to confirm the presence of tumor-specific viral isolates. Exons 5-9 of the TP53 gene were sequenced from 166 specimens. The hazard of death from HNSCC in patients with and without HPV-positive tumors was determined by proportional hazards regression analysis. RESULTS: HPV was detected in 62 (25%) of 253 cases (95% confidence interval [CI] = 19%-30%). High-risk, tumorigenic type HPV16 was identified in 90% of the HPV-positive tumors. HPV16 was localized specifically by in situ hybridization within the nuclei of cancer cells in preinvasive, invasive, and lymph node disease. Southern blot hybridization patterns were consistent with viral integration. Poor tumor grade (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.2- 4.9) and oropharyngeal site (OR = 6.2; 95% CI = 3.1-12.1) independently increased the probability of HPV presence. As compared with HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers were less likely to occur among moderate to heavy drinkers (OR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.05-0.61) and smokers (OR = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.02-1.4), had a characteristic basaloid morphology (OR = 18.7; 95% CI = 2.1-167), were less likely to have TP53 mutations (OR = 0.06; 95% CI = 0.01-0. 36), and had improved disease-specific survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.07-0.98). After adjustment for the presence of lymph node disease (HR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.4- 3.8), heavy alcohol consumption (HR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.4-4.7), and age greater than 60 years old (HR = 1.4; 95% CI = 0.8-2.3), all patients with HPV-positive tumors had a 59% reduction in risk of death from cancer when compared with HPV-negative HNSCC patients (HR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.20-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: These data extend recent molecular and epidemiologic studies and strongly suggest that HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers comprise a distinct molecular, clinical, and pathologic disease entity that is likely causally associated with HPV infection and that has a markedly improved prognosis.},

Poor tumor grade (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.2- 4.9) and oropharyngeal site (OR = 6.2; 95% CI = 3.1-12.1) independently increased the probability of HPV presence. As compared with HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers were less likely to occur among moderate to heavy drinkers (OR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.05-0.61) and smokers (OR = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.02-1.4), had a characteristic basaloid morphology (OR = 18.7; 95% CI = 2.1-167), were less likely to have TP53 mutations (OR = 0.06; 95% CI = 0.01-0. 36), and had improved disease-specific survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.07-0.98). After adjustment for the presence of lymph node disease (HR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.4- 3.8), heavy alcohol consumption (HR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.4-4.7), and age greater than 60 years old (HR = 1.4; 95% CI = 0.8-2.3), all patients with HPV-positive tumors had a 59% reduction in risk of death from cancer when compared with HPV-negative HNSCC patients (HR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.20-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: These data extend recent molecular and epidemiologic studies and strongly suggest that HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers comprise a distinct molecular, clinical, and pathologic disease entity that is likely causally associated with HPV infection and that has a markedly improved prognosis.},

	abstract = {High-throughput technologies have been developed in the hope of increasing the pace of biomedical research, and accelerating the rate of translation from bench to bedside. Using such technology in target discovery has resulted in the need for systematic validation of the targets in an equally rapid manner. For example, gene expression microarrays have highlighted many potential targets in cancer, and tissue microarrays have emerged as a powerful tool to validate these targets by measuring tumor-specific protein expression and linking it to clinical outcome. Automated quantitative analysis of the tissue microarray 'spots' is beginning to take the technology a step further, removing observer bias, and providing standards for quality control and the potential for high-throughput analysis. The validation required for translation of tissue biomarkers from the research lab to the clinical lab will probably rely heavily on the combination of tissue microarray technology with automated quantitative analysis.},

	abstract = {Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) is a causative agent in a subgroup of head and neck carcinomas, particularly tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas (TSCC). This study was undertaken because controversial data exist on the physical status of HPV-DNA and the use of p16(INK4A) overexpression as surrogate HPV marker, and to examine the impact of HPV and tobacco consumption on the clinical course of TSCC. Tissue sections of 81 TSCC were analyzed by HPV 16-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and p16(INK4A)-specific immunohistochemistry. Results were correlated with clinical and demographic data. HPV 16 integration was detected by FISH as punctate signals in 33 out of 81 (41%) TSCC, 32 of which showed p16(INK4A) accumulation. Only 5 out of 48 HPV-negative tumors showed p16(INK4A) immunostaining (p < 0.0001). The presence of HPV furthermore correlates significantly with low tobacco (p = 0.002) and alcohol intake (p = 0.011), poor differentiation grade (p = 0.019), small tumor size (p = 0.024), presence of a local metastasis (p = 0.001) and a decreased (loco)regional recurrence rate (p = 0.039). Statistical analysis revealed that smoking significantly increases the risk of cancer death from TSCC and that non-smoking patients with HPV-containing TSCC show a remarkably better disease-specific survival rate. HPV 16 is integrated in 41% of TSCC and strongly correlates with p16(INK4A) overexpression, implicating the latter to be a reliable HPV biomarker. Patients with HPV-positive tumors show a favorable prognosis as compared to those with HPV-negative tumors, but tobacco use is the strongest prognostic indicator. These findings indicate that oncogenic processes in the tonsils of non-smokers differ from those occurring in smokers, the former being related to HPV 16 infection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: At least 75% of head and neck cancers are attributable to a combination of cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking. A precise understanding of the independent association of each of these factors in the absence of the other with the risk of head and neck cancer is needed to elucidate mechanisms of head and neck carcinogenesis and to assess the efficacy of interventions aimed at controlling either risk factor. METHODS: We examined the extent to which head and neck cancer is associated with cigarette smoking among never drinkers and with alcohol drinking among never users of tobacco. We pooled individual-level data from 15 case-control studies that included 10,244 head and neck cancer case subjects and 15,227 control subjects, of whom 1072 case subjects and 5775 control subjects were never users of tobacco and 1598 case subjects and 4051 control subjects were never drinkers of alcohol. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Among never drinkers, cigarette smoking was associated with an increased risk of head and neck cancer (OR for ever versus never smoking = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.52 to 2.98), and there were clear dose-response relationships for the frequency, duration, and number of pack-years of cigarette smoking. Approximately 24% (95% CI = 16% to 31%) of head and neck cancer cases among nondrinkers in this study would have been prevented if these individuals had not smoked cigarettes. Among never users of tobacco, alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of head and neck cancer only when alcohol was consumed at high frequency (OR for three or more drinks per day versus never drinking = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.29 to 3.21). The association with high-frequency alcohol intake was limited to cancers of the oropharynx/hypopharynx and larynx. CONCLUSIONS: Our results represent the most precise estimates available of the independent association of each of the two main risk factors of head and neck cancer, and they exemplify the strengths of large-scale consortia in cancer epidemiology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The magnitude of risk conferred by the interaction between tobacco and alcohol use on the risk of head and neck cancers is not clear because studies have used various methods to quantify the excess head and neck cancer burden. METHODS: We analyzed individual-level pooled data from 17 European and American case-control studies (11,221 cases and 16,168 controls) participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology consortium. We estimated the multiplicative interaction parameter (psi) and population attributable risks (PAR). RESULTS: A greater than multiplicative joint effect between ever tobacco and alcohol use was observed for head and neck cancer risk (psi = 2.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.53-3.04). The PAR for tobacco or alcohol was 72% (95% confidence interval, 61-79%) for head and neck cancer, of which 4% was due to alcohol alone, 33% was due to tobacco alone, and 35% was due to tobacco and alcohol combined. The total PAR differed by subsite (64% for oral cavity cancer, 72% for pharyngeal cancer, 89% for laryngeal cancer), by sex (74% for men, 57% for women), by age (33% for cases <45 years, 73% for cases >60 years), and by region (84% in Europe, 51% in North America, 83% in Latin America). CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that the joint effect between tobacco and alcohol use is greater than multiplicative on head and neck cancer risk. However, a substantial proportion of head and neck cancers cannot be attributed to tobacco or alcohol use, particularly for oral cavity cancer and for head and neck cancer among women and among young-onset cases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite several lines of evidence suggesting the biological plausibility of marijuana being carcinogenic, epidemiologic findings are inconsistent. We conducted a population-based case-control study of the association between marijuana use and the risk of lung and upper aerodigestive tract cancers in Los Angeles. METHODS: Our study included 1,212 incident cancer cases and 1,040 cancer-free controls matched to cases on age, gender, and neighborhood. Subjects were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire. The cumulative use of marijuana was expressed in joint-years, where 1 joint-year is equivalent to smoking one joint per day for 1 year. RESULTS: Although using marijuana for > or =30 joint-years was positively associated in the crude analyses with each cancer type (except pharyngeal cancer), no positive associations were observed when adjusting for several confounders including cigarette smoking. The adjusted odds ratio estimate (and 95% confidence limits) for > or =60 versus 0 joint-years was 1.1 (0.56, 2.1) for oral cancer, 0.84 (0.28, 2.5) for laryngeal cancer, and 0.62 (0.32, 1.2) for lung cancer; the adjusted odds ratio estimate for > or =30 versus 0 joint-years was 0.57 (0.20, 1.6) for pharyngeal cancer, and 0.53 (0.22, 1.3) for esophageal cancer. No association was consistently monotonic across exposure categories, and restriction to subjects who never smoked cigarettes yielded similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results may have been affected by selection bias or error in measuring lifetime exposure and confounder histories; but they suggest that the association of these cancers with marijuana, even long-term or heavy use, is not strong and may be below practically detectable limits.},

It introduces the current best practice in histopathology and cytopathology as it pertains to head and neck and thyroid cancers. Recommendations * Accurate diagnosis of the type of malignancy is a key component of effective management. (R) * Surgeons and oncologists should understand the scope and limitations of cellular pathology in order to inform multidisciplinary discussions. (R) * A clinically suspected diagnosis of malignancy should be confirmed by biopsy or cytology before operation. (R) * Cytopathological diagnoses should be discussed with surgeons and radiologists to maximise the information gained from each modality of investigation. (R) * Pathological investigations are the basis for accurate cancer staging and stratification of clinical outcomes. (R).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anaemia is associated with poor cancer control, particularly in patients undergoing radiotherapy. We investigated whether anaemia correction with epoetin beta could improve outcome of curative radiotherapy among patients with head and neck cancer. METHODS: We did a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 351 patients (haemoglobin <120 g/L in women or <130 g/L in men) with carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. Patients received curative radiotherapy at 60 Gy for completely (R0) and histologically incomplete (R1) resected disease, or 70 Gy for macroscopically incompletely resected (R2) advanced disease (T3, T4, or nodal involvement) or for primary definitive treatment. All patients were assigned to subcutaneous placebo (n=171) or epoetin beta 300 IU/kg (n=180) three times weekly, from 10-14 days before and continuing throughout radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was locoregional progression-free survival. We assessed also time to locoregional progression and survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: 148 (82%) patients given epoetin beta achieved haemoglobin concentrations higher than 140 g/L (women) or 150 g/L (men) compared with 26 (15%) given placebo. However, locoregional progression-free survival was poorer with epoetin beta than with placebo (adjusted relative risk 1.62 [95% CI 1.22-2.14]; p=0.0008). For locoregional progression the relative risk was 1.69 (1.16-2.47, p=0.007) and for survival was 1.39 (1.05-1.84, p=0.02). INTERPRETATION: Epoetin beta corrects anaemia but does not improve cancer control or survival. Disease control might even be impaired. Patients receiving curative cancer treatment and given erythropoietin should be studied in carefully controlled trials.},

@article{RN151,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV), the causal agent of cervical cancer, appears to be involved in the etiology of cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx. To investigate these associations, we conducted a multicenter case-control study of cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx in nine countries. METHODS: We recruited 1670 case patients (1415 with cancer of the oral cavity and 255 with cancer of the oropharynx) and 1732 control subjects and obtained an interview, oral exfoliated cells, and blood from all participants and fresh biopsy specimens from case patients. HPV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antibodies against HPV16 L1, E6, and E7 proteins in plasma were detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Multivariable models were used for case-control and case-case comparisons. RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in biopsy specimens of 3.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.5% to 5.3%) of 766 cancers of the oral cavity with valid PCR results and 18.3% (95% CI = 12.0% to 24.7%) of 142 cancers of the oropharynx (oropharynx and tonsil combined) with valid PCR results. HPV DNA in cancer biopsy specimens was detected less frequently among tobacco smokers and paan chewers and more frequently among subjects who reported more than one sexual partner or who practiced oral sex. HPV16 DNA was found in 94.7% of HPV DNA-positive case patients. HPV DNA in exfoliated cells was not associated with cancer risk or with HPV DNA detection in biopsy specimens. Antibodies against HPV16 L1 were associated with risk for cancers of the oral cavity (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1 to 2.1) and the oropharynx (OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 2.1 to 5.9). Antibodies against HPV16 E6 or E7 were also associated with risk for cancers of the oral cavity (OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.7 to 4.8) and the oropharynx (OR = 9.2, 95% CI = 4.8 to 17.7). CONCLUSIONS: HPV appears to play an etiologic role in many cancers of the oropharynx and possibly a small subgroup of cancers of the oral cavity. The most common HPV type in genital cancers (HPV16) was also the most common in these tumors. The mechanism of transmission of HPV to the oral cavity warrants further investigation.},

Most EBV-associated tumours are rare or occur at higher incidence only in certain geographical regions. The recently reported detection of EBV in gastric, breast, and hepatocellular carcinomas raises the possibility of involvement of the virus in the pathogenesis of common cancers. This article reviews the evidence linking EBV infection to epithelial tumours. It is concluded that at present, there is no convincing evidence to suggest that breast carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma are EBV-associated tumours.},

	abstract = {It is now clear that the two separate entitles of tonsillar cancer, HPV induced and non-HPV induced (smoking induced), have significantly different presenting stage and outcomes. A significant proportion of patients with human papillomavirus positive tonsillar cancer have had exposure to smoking. We examined the combined effect of human papillomavirus and smoking on the outcomes and determined whether smoking can modify the beneficial effect of human papillomavirus. A total of 403 patients from nine centers were followed up for recurrence or death for a median of 38 months. Determinants of the rate of loco-regional recurrence, death from tonsillar cancer and overall survival were modeled using Cox regression. Smoking status was a significant predictor of overall survival (p = 0.04). There were nonstatistically significant trends favoring never smokers for loco-regional recurrence and disease specific survival. In addition, there was no statistically significant interactions between smoking and human papillomavirus (p-values for the interaction were 0.26 for loco-regional recurrence, 0.97 for disease specific survival and 0.73 for overall survival). The effect of smoking on loco-regional recurrence and disease specific survival outcomes was not statistically significant, nor was there significant evidence that the effect of smoking status on these outcomes was modified by HPV status. Irrespective of HPV status, however, smokers did have poorer overall survival than never-smokers, presumably due to effects of smoking that are unrelated to the primary cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A 5 week-hyperfractionated and accelerated radiotherapy regimen without reduction of the total dose was developed to fight tumour repopulation during treatment and tumour hypoxia. The purpose of the study was to try to improve loco-regional control in high risk head and neck carcinoma treated with curative radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1985 to 1995, a randomised controlled trial of the EORTC Cooperative Group of Radiotherapy (EORTC 22851) compared the experimental regimen (72 Gy/45 fractions/5 weeks) to standard fractionation and overall treatment time (70 Gy/35 fractions/7 weeks) in T2, T3 and T4 head and neck cancers (hypopharynx excluded). The end-point criteria were local and loco-regional control, overall and disease-free survival, and acute and late toxicities. Five hundred twelve patients were accrued. RESULTS: Patients in the AF (accelerated fractionation) arm did significantly better with regard to loco-regional control (P = 0.02) resulting at 5 years in a 13% gain (95% CI 3-23% gain) in loco-regional control over the CF (conventional fractionation) arm. This improvement is of larger magnitude in patients with poorer prognosis (N2-3 any T, T4 any N) than in patients with more favourable stage. Multivariate analysis confirmed AF as an independent prognostic factor of good prognosis for loco-regional control (P = 0.03). Specific survival shows a trend (P = 0.06) in favour of the AF arm. ACUTE AND LATE TOXICITIES: Acute and late toxicity were increased in the AF arm. Late severe functional irradiation damage occurred in 14% of patients of the AF arm versus 4% in the CF arm. Two cases of radiation-induced myelitis occurred after doses of 42 and 48 Gy to the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS: This trial shows that accelerated radiotherapy improves loco-regional control in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. A less toxic scheme should, however, be investigated and documented before using accelerated radiotherapy as a standard regimen of curative radiotherapy for head and neck cancers.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are held accountable for the progress of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In the presented study, the authors evaluated the prognostic value of CSC markers in two particular HNSCC cohorts. METHODS: This two cohort study consisted of 85 patients with advanced stage HNSCC, treated with primary radio(chemo)therapy (pRCT), and 95 patients with HNSCC, treated with surgery and partially adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) were assessed. Samples were assessed for the expression of different molecular stem cell markers (ALDH1, BCL11B, BMI1, and CD44). RESULTS: In the pRCT cohort, none of the baseline patient and tumor features exhibited a statistically significant relation with survival in either the cohort or the human papillomavirus (HPV)-stratified subcohorts. High expression of BMI1 significantly decreased OS and DFS, while high expression of CD44 decreased all modes of survival. Multivariate analysis showed significant prognostic influence for all tested CSC markers, with high BMI1 and CD44 decreasing survival (BMI-1: OS, DFS, DSS; CD44: OS, DFS) and high ALDH1 and BCL11B showing a beneficial effect on survival (ALDH1: OS, DFS; BCL11B: OS, DSS). In the surgical cohort, classical prognosticators such as HPV status, R1 resection, and nodal status in HPV-negative HNSCC played a significant role, but the tested CSC markers showed no significant effect on prognosis. CONCLUSION: Although validation in independent cohorts is still needed, testing for CSC markers in patients with advanced or late stage HNSCC might be beneficial, especially if many comorbidities exist or disease is irresectable. The findings might guide the development and earlier use of targeted therapies in the future.},

Combining the two modalities of therapy produced a local and regional control of the disease in twice as many patients as did one modality alone. The absolute 5-year survival did not reflect this same trend, however, since as local and regional control increased, more patients lived longer but died before five years from distant metastases.

DKTK was founded in 2012 following international peer review and has positioned itself since then as the leading network for translational cancer research in Germany. DKTK is long term funded by the German Ministry of Research and Education and the federal states of each DKTK partner site. DKTK acts at the interface between basic and clinical cancer research, one major focus being to generate suitable multisite cooperation structures and provide the basis for including higher numbers of patients and facilitate effective collaborative forward and reverse translational cancer research. The consortium addresses areas of high scientific and medical relevance and develops critical infrastructures, for example, for omics technologies, clinical and research big data exchange and analysis, imaging, and clinical grade drug manufacturing. Moreover, DKTK provides a very attractive environment for interdisciplinary and interinstitutional training and career development for clinician and medical scientists.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The neck lymph nodes are a common site of metastases from carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP syndrome). 2[(18) F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18-FDG-PET) has been shown to be a sensitive tool for detecting primary malignant lesions as well as metastatic spread. We have prospectively investigated the sensitivity of 18-FDG-PET in detecting occult primary carcinomas with manifestation in the head and neck lymph nodes. METHODS: From May 1994 to July 1998, in 723 patients a cancer of the head and neck was diagnosed at the University of Cologne ENT outpatient clinic. The routinely performed staging procedures were chest radiography; full blood count; cervical and liver ultrasound; endoscopy of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, and esophagus; and laboratory analyses. After the staging workup, in 27 of 723 patients (3.7%) CUP syndrome had to be presumed because the primary cancer could not be detected. In these patients 18-FDG-PET was performed, and images were reconstructed with a transmission-emission fusion technique. RESULTS: In 7 of 27 patients (26%) 18-FDG-PET revealed an unknown primary: in 2 a bronchial carcinoma, in 2 a nasopharyngeal carcinoma, in 1 a squamous cell carcinoma of the parotid gland, in 1 a squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx, and in 1 a carcinoma of the tonsil. In 4 of 7 patients the occult primary tumor was removed surgically. In 8 of 27 patients therapeutic strategy was changed as a result of the 18-FDG-PET findings. CONCLUSION: 18-FDG-PET should be performed in all patients with CUP syndrome after conventional diagnostic workup fails to identify the primary.},

METHOD: A multidisciplinary committee was formed representing all medical and paramedical disciplines involved in the management of laryngeal cancer and all head and neck oncology centers in The Netherlands. This committee reviewed the literature and formulated statements and recommendations based on the level of evidence and consistency of the literature data. Where reliable literature data were not available, recommendations were based on expert opinion. RESULTS: Strict criteria have been proposed for the radiological diagnostic procedures as well as for the pathology report. For carcinoma in situ and severe dysplasia, microsurgery, preferably by laser, is proposed. For all other stages of invasive carcinoma, a full course of radiotherapy as a voice conserving therapy is the treatment of choice. Only in cases with massive tumor volumes with invasion through the laryngeal skeleton, primary surgery is inevitable. For rehabilitation and supportive care, minimal criteria are described. Due to the complexity of therapy and relative rarity of larynx carcinoma, all patients should be seen at least once in a dedicated head and neck clinic. CONCLUSION: This guideline for the management of larynx carcinoma was produced by a multidisciplinary national committee and based on scientific evidence wherever possible. This procedure of guideline development has created the optimal conditions for nationwide acceptance and implementation of the guideline.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In recent years, various therapeutic concepts have been developed for treating oral cancer, these include preoperative simultaneous "neoadjuvant" radio-chemotherapy and one-stage-surgery with tumour ablation and reconstruction. When considering long-term survival, there is substantial evidence that the neoadjuvant therapy is superior to the primary surgical approach with postoperative radiation. Both treatment concepts, however, have a strong impact on the quality of life. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study prospectively evaluates and compares quality of life in 53 patients with oral cancer treated according to a neoadjuvant concept or primarily surgically, using the questionnaires QLQ C-30 and H and N35 by the EORTC. RESULTS: Initially both groups showed a marked reduction in the quality of life. Despite a clear improvement in the first postoperative year baseline values were not reached in most of the scores. Specific long-lasting impairments in the symptom scales concerning oral functions were found in both treatment arms. In the neoadjuvant therapy group, however, especially global health and the emotional status were reduced to a higher degree than in the other group. This was particularly noticeable in the early treatment phase. CONCLUSIONS: Following an initial deterioration of quality-of-life after 3 months a gradual improvement of physical and psychological function was observed in the course of the first post-treatment year in both groups. Severe side effects can be observed. These side effects vary strongly in their individual expression. Limitations in the quality of life can be justified, if the more aggressive therapy resulted in a better disease free survival.},

	abstract = {Basaloid squamous carcinoma (BSC) is a rare distinct variant of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region. This entity may commonly pose diagnostic difficulties, especially on small biopsy material. We report the clinicopathological characteristics of 12 new cases and compare their immunohistochemical features with those of solid adenoid cystic carcinomas and conventional squamous cell carcinomas. Our results show that neoplastic BSCs and squamous cell carcinomas do not react to vimentin and S100 protein, while adenoid cystic carcinomas manifest both. The BSCs, however, are S100 protein-positive in intratumoral dendritic Langerhans' cells that are lacking in squamous cell and adenoid cystic carcinomas. Our findings indicate that the immunohistochemical differences between BSC and adenoid cystic carcinoma could assist in their differential diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are thought to be one of the causal factors in the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), particularly in tumors arising from the Waldeyer's tonsillar ring. We screened 98 carefully stratified HNSCC and different control tissues for the presence of HPV DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for genital- and Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV)-associated HPVs and by HPV16-specific single step PCR. Typing was performed by direct sequencing and/or sequencing of cloned amplimers. On average HNSCC showed rather low HPV DNA prevalences; 18% of the oral cavity cancers, 8% of nasopharyngeal cancers, 25% of hypopharyngeal cancers and 7% of laryngeal cancers were HPV DNA positive. In contrast, HPV sequences could be detected in 45% of the oropharyngeal cancers, particularly tonsillar carcinomas (58%). Tonsillar carcinomas were significantly more likely to be HPV positive than tumors from any other site ( P<0.001). All tonsillar cancers contained oncogenic HPV types, predominantly HPV16 (13 of 14; 93%). Unaffected tonsils were available from two of these patients, but both tested negative for HPV DNA. Furthermore, no HPV DNA could be found in tonsillar biopsy specimens from control groups. Localization and load of HPV DNA was determined in HPV16-positive tonsillar carcinomas, their metastases and in unaffected mucosa using laser-assisted microdissection and subsequent real time fluorescence PCR. We demonstrated that the HPV genome is located in the cancer cells, whereas the infection of normal mucosa is a rare event. Quantification of HPV16 DNA in samples of seven patients yielded viral loads from 6 to 153 HPV DNA copies per beta-globin gene copy and the load values in both locations were roughly comparable. These loads are comparable with data shown for other HPV-associated lesions. Statistical evaluation of data related to clinicopathological parameters showed a significant correlation of the HPV positivity of tonsillar carcinomas with tumor grading ( P=0.008) and alcohol consumption ( P=0.029). Taken together our findings show a preferential association of HPV DNA with tonsillar carcinomas. Furthermore our results argue for HPV-positive tonsillar carcinomas representing a separate tumor entity, which is less dependent on conventional HNSCC risk factors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV) DNA have repeatedly been observed in many head and neck carcinomas (HNSCCs), and HPV infections are currently considered a possible factor in the etiology of these tumors. However, the reported prevalences of HPV-DNA in HNSCC are variable. In the current study the authors used highly sensitive polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) to analyze the occurrence of viral sequences in 98 carefully stratified HNSCCs. The authors determined the load and localization of HPV DNA in a subset of tonsillar carcinomas and their metastases. METHODS: Nested PCR and an HPV16 specific single step PCR were used to screen 98 HNSCCs for HPV DNA for genital- and Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV)-associated HPVs. Typing was performed by direct sequencing and/or sequencing of cloned amplimers. In two patients HPV16 subtypes in tonsillar carcinomas and their metastases were compared by amplification and sequencing of the long control region of the virus. In a subset of HPV16 positive tonsillar carcinomas and their metastases, localization and viral load were determined using laser assisted microdissection and real time fluorescent PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Altogether 25 HNSCCs (26%) were found to be HPV positive. Stratified according to the tumor localization, the frequency of HPV positive lesions was 18% in the oral cavity, 45% for oropharynx, 25% for hypopharynx, 8% for nasopharynx, and 7% for larynx. The highest HPV DNA prevalence (58%) was found in tonsillar carcinomas. The high risk HPV type 16 was found in 84% of positive HNSCCs, in 14% of which EV-associated HPVs were detected. Human papillomavirus sequences were detected in 64% of biopsies with normal mucosa from 11 patients with positive carcinomas. As a control group, 14 tumor free tonsils were analyzed. In none of these specimens were HPV sequences detected. Viral long transcriptional control region sequences in homologous metastases were identical with those in primary tumors and the load values in both locations were roughly comparable. Viral loads differed substantially in different areas of one tumor. Statistical evaluation of data related to clinicopathologic parameters showed a significant linkage of HPV with tonsillar carcinomas compared to other locations. Furthermore, a significant correlation of HPV status of tonsillar carcinomas with tumor grading and alcohol consumption was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a preferential association of HPV-DNA with tonsillar carcinomas. The data support the view of HPV negative and positive tonsillar carcinomas being different tumor entities and conventional cancer risk factors being of less importance in HPV-infected individuals. The HPV genome is located in the cancer cells, whereas the infection of normal mucosa is a rare event. Data on quantification of HPV16 in tonsillar tumors and their metastases showed mean viral loads comparable to other HPV associated malignancies.},

METHODS: This retrospective study included 373 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity who underwent 401 neck dissections between January 1986 and December 1995 at the Department for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Hanover Medical School. RESULTS: The 5-year regional control was estimated at 87%. Relapse occurred only within the first 2 years after neck dissection. The number of positive nodes, metastases without lymphatic tissue, preparation of metastases from the carotid artery and cranial base, and preoperative radiochemotherapy were analyzed as prognostic factors with significant influence. The grade of metastases, extracapsular spread, lymphangiosis carcinomatosa, and postoperative radiation showed no prognostic significance. DISCUSSION: The comparison of recurrent metastases after radical and modified neck dissection demonstrated that as the extent of neck disease increased there was a tendency toward improved regional control after radical neck dissection.},

All patients were staged prior to definitive treatment and were autopsied. The overall incidence of distant metastases was 47 percent. The hypopharynx had the highest incidence of distant metastases (60 percent), followed by the base of the tongue (53 percent) and the anterior tongue (50 percent). Of the 387 patients with distant metastases, 91 percent died with uncontrolled tumor either at the primary site or in the neck. The lung was the most common site of distant metastases (80 percent), followed by the mediastinal nodes (34 percent), the liver (31 percent), and bone (31 percent). Overall, 6 percent of the patients had stage I disease, 20 percent had stage II disease, 32 percent had stage III disease, and 43 percent had stage IV disease. The highest incidence of distant metastases was found in those patients with stage IV disease (193 of 350 patients, 55 percent). We believe that the initial stage of disease does appear to be related to the ultimate development of the distant metastases.},

	abstract = {Improved diagnostic techniques and more effective treatment concepts have resulted in a growing number of patients with oropharyngeal cancer diagnosed with second primary tumours. In order to evaluate the relative number of patients with second primary tumours and to estimate the efficacy of diagnostic procedures, a retrospective evaluation of 981 patients with oropharyngeal cancer, who were treated during 20 years in one single medical centre, was performed. In total, 9.2% of the patients were affected by secondary cancer, 1.5% from tertiary cancer and 0.2% from quartary cancer. Of the multiple cancers, 27.8% occurred synchronously and 72.2% metachronously. If the index tumour was located at the oral floor or the pharynx, the risk of second primary tumours was enhanced; if the index tumour was located at the lips or the tongue, the risk was reduced. The 5-year survival of all examined patients was 34.1%; the survival of patients with multiple cancers was 62.3% at the diagnosis of the index tumour and dropped to 30.5% at the diagnosis of an additional malignancy. Of the second primary tumours, 23.2% were diagnosed by panendoscopy. We conclude that among patients with oropharyngeal cancer, the presence of second primary tumours always has to be considered and that panendoscopy is a valuable tool for their diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Between March 1973 and June 1979, patients with advanced operable squamous cell carcinoma of the supraglottic larynx or hypopharynx were randomly allocated to receive either preoperative radiation therapy (5,000 rad) or postoperative radiation therapy (6,000 rad). Patients with oral cavity or oropharynx lesions were randomly assigned either preoperative radiation, postoperative radiation, or definitive radiation therapy (6,500-7,000 rad), with surgery reserved for salvage if residual disease was present 6 weeks after completion of irradiation. Three hundred twenty patients were evaluable with a median follow-up of 60 months. Based on results in 277 patients across all four regions combined, locoregional control was significantly better for patients assigned to receive postoperative radiation therapy (65%) compared with those assigned to receive preoperative radiation therapy (48%, P = 0.04). This was due to a higher rate of both persistent and recurrent local and regional disease in the preoperative group. Survival also showed a trend to be better in the postoperative group (38%) compared with the preoperative group (33%, P = 0.10). Rates of severe surgical and radiation therapy complications were similar overall. Forty-three patients were evaluable for each of the three treatment regimens assigned to patients with oral cavity or oropharynx lesions. Due to the small number of patients available for this portion of the trial, the observed differences for overall survival (4-year percentage 33% overall; 30% preoperative, 36% postoperative, 33% definitive radiation therapy) and for locoregional control (45% overall; 43% preoperative, 52% postoperative, 38% definitive radiation therapy) were not statistically significant. The use of definitive radiation therapy with surgical rescue as an ethically justified alternative treatment for these tumors remains a question for further research.},

	abstract = {Inactivation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is of utmost importance for tumor cure after radiotherapy. An increasing body of evidence complies with a higher radioresistance of CSCs compared to the mass of tumor cells, supporting the use of CSC related biomarkers for prediction of radiotherapy outcome. Treatment individualization strategies for patient groups with vastly different risk of recurrence will most likely require application of more than one biomarker. Specifically, inclusion of established biomarkers like tumor size for primary radio(chemo)therapy or human papilloma virus (HPV) infection status in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma seems to be of very high relevance. The high heterogeneity of CSC subclones along with changes of the functional behavior of individual tumors under treatment underlines the importance of the selection of the optimal timepoint(s) of biomarker evaluation, but also provides a potential therapeutic target for combined treatment approaches with irradiation.},

@article{RN22,
	abstract = {Cancer stem cells (CSC) have the unique ability to cause tumor recurrences if they survive treatment. Radiotherapy has curative potential because it has been functionally shown to sufficiently inactivate CSCs. It is well known that CSCs mediate the radiation resistance of tumors by tumor-specific factors, such as the pretreatment number of CSCs and repopulation or reoxygenation during fractionated radiotherapy. CSCs appear to have a higher intrinsic radioresistance than non-CSCs, a factor that is especially important for the development of predictive biomarkers that, if this finding holds true, can only be successfully established if they are stem-cell specific. Recent clinical data imply that stem-cell-related surface markers may be directly used as predictors for the radiocurability of tumors with comparable risk factors, such as histology and size. Future studies need to address the question of which additional markers need to be considered if more heterogeneous patient collectives are investigated. With the goal of developing a direct targeting approach, investigators are currently evaluating several drugs that are intended to target CSCs by inhibiting stem-cell-related signal transduction pathways. We need to preclinically test such drugs as combined-modality therapies in combination with radiotherapy to evaluate their curative potential, and optimize them by increasing their specificity to CSCs over normal tissue stem cells to avoid increased radiation toxicity.},

	abstract = {Mucosal human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the cause of cervical cancer and likely a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), yet the global prevalence and type distribution of HPV in HNSCC remains unclear. We systematically reviewed published studies of HNSCC biopsies that employed PCR-based methods to detect and genotype HPV to describe the prevalence and type distribution of HPV by anatomic cancer site. Geographic location and study size were investigated as possible sources of variability. In the 5,046 HNSCC cancer specimens from 60 studies, the overall HPV prevalence was 25.9% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 24.7-27.2]. HPV prevalence was significantly higher in oropharyngeal SCCs (35.6% of 969; 95% CI, 32.6-38.7) than oral SCCs (23.5% of 2,642; 95% CI, 21.9-25.1) or laryngeal SCCs (24.0% of 1,435; 95% CI, 21.8-26.3). HPV16 accounted for a larger majority of HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCCs (86.7%; 95% CI, 82.6-90.1) compared with HPV-positive oral SCCs (68.2%; 95% CI, 64.4-71.9) and laryngeal SCCs (69.2%; 95% CI, 64.0-74.0). Conversely, HPV18 was rare in HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCCs (2.8%; 95% CI, 1.3-5.3) compared with other head and neck sites [34.1% (95% CI, 30.4-38.0) of oral SCCs and 17.0% (95% CI, 13.0-21.6) of laryngeal SCCs]. Aside from HPV16 and HPV18, other oncogenic HPVs were rarely detected in HNSCC. Tumor site-specific HPV prevalence was higher among studies from North America compared with Europe and Asia. The high HPV16 prevalence and the lack of HPV18 in oropharyngeal compared with other HNSCCs may point to specific virus-tissue interactions. Small sample size and publication bias complicate the assessment of the prevalence of HPV in head and neck sites beyond the oropharynx.},

Compared to conventional radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is associated with fewer long-term toxicities and better quality of life. Whether IMRT improves local control in these patients needs to be further investigated. The risk factors and treatment toxicities must be taken into consideration and discussed with the patients. New approaches combining radiotherapy and biological targets are a treatment option. The implementation of these substances in treatment protocols is increasing. Sensitive and specific prognostic biomarkers for patient identification to optimize treatment selection are important, but reliable parameters are still missing.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of treatment-related toxicity on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with radiotherapy either alone or in combination with chemotherapy or surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study sample was composed of 425 disease-free patients. Toxicity was scored according to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) late radiation-induced morbidity scoring system. HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire C30. These assessments took place at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after completion of radiotherapy. The analysis was performed using a multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: Of the six RTOG scales investigated, two significantly affected self-reported HRQoL, salivary gland (RTOG(xerostomia)) and esophagus/pharynx (RTOG(swallowing)). Although RTOG(xerostomia) was reported most frequently, HRQoL was most affected by RTOG(swallowing), particularly in the first 18 months after completion of radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Late radiation-induced toxicity, particularly RTOG(swallowing) and RTOG(xerostomia), has a significant impact on the more general dimensions of HRQoL. These findings suggest that the development of new radiation-induced delivery techniques should not only focus on reduction of the dose to the salivary glands, but also on anatomic structures that are involved in swallowing.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to define different prognostic groups with regard to locoregional control (LRC) derived from recursive partitioning analysis (RPA). METHODS: Eight hundred one patients with squamous cell head and neck carcinoma underwent with primary surgery and received postoperative radiotherapy. For the definition of prognostic groups, the method of classification and regression trees was performed, including a large number of well known prognostic factors. RESULTS: The final model was composed of six prognostic factors for LRC, resulting in seven terminal nodes. RPA Class I (intermediate risk) consisted of 381 patients who had no N3 lymph nodes, free surgical margins (> 5 mm), and no extranodal spread (ENS). RPA Class II (high risk) consisted of 189 patients who had 1 positive lymph node with ENS or had T1, T2, or T4 tumors with close or positive surgical margins. RPA Class III (very high risk) consisted of 231 patients who had a N3 neck, > or = 2 positive lymph nodes with ENS, or a T3 tumor with close or positive surgical margins. The 5-year LRC rate was 88%, 73% and 58%, in RPA Class I, II, and III, respectively (P < 0.0001). The hazard ratio (HR) relative to RPA Class I was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [95%CI], 1.5-3.6) for RPA Class II and 4.2 (95%CI, 2.8-6.1) for RPA Class III. CONCLUSIONS: The RPA classification scheme studied allowed for the clear definition of three prognostic groups with regard to LRC and OS. These groups may be useful in the design of future prospective, randomized studies investigating new treatment modalities.},

@article{RN148,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Asbestos is the name given to a group of naturally occurring silicate mineral fibres that were widely used in industry during the 20th century due to their desirable physical properties. Although use in the USA has fallen over the last three decades, significant exposure in the developing world continues and the burden of disease is considerable. Asbestos is a known risk factor for several malignant diseases, including lung cancer and mesothelioma, and has more recently been implicated in pharyngeal and laryngeal cancer. However, studies of asbestos and cancers of the larynx or pharynx with adequate sample size that control for major head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) risk factors remain relatively sparse. METHODS: We report findings from a case-control study of 674 incident male HNSCC cases from the greater Boston region and 857 population-based male controls, matched on age ($\pm$3 years), sex, and town or neighbourhood of residence. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between occupational asbestos exposure and HNSCC by primary tumour site. RESULTS: 190 cases (28.2%) and 203 controls (23.7%) reported occupational exposure to asbestos. Occupational asbestos exposure was associated with elevated risk of pharyngeal carcinoma in men (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.97), adjusted for age, race, smoking, alcohol consumption, education, income and HPV16 serology, with borderline increasing risk for each decade in the exposed occupation (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.23). CONCLUSIONS: These observations are consistent with mounting evidence that asbestos is a risk factor for pharyngeal cancer.},

@article{RN245,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) is often recommended for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC), its effect on overall or cancer-specific survival has not been clearly demonstrated. In the current study, the frequency and effect of adjuvant RT on overall survival was investigated in patients with resected lymph node-positive head and neck cancer. METHODS: Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, patients were selected with lymph node-positive HNSCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer and SEER stage 3/4) who were treated either with surgery alone or surgery and RT and were diagnosed between 1988 and 2001. A total of 8795 patients who met the inclusion criteria for analysis comprised the study population, with a median follow-up of 4.3 years for patients still alive at the time of last follow-up. RESULTS: Adjuvant RT was utilized in 84% of patients. Adjuvant RT improved the 5-year overall survival (43.2% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 41.9-44.4%] for surgery + RT vs 33.4% [95% CI, 30.7-36.0%] for surgery alone; P < .001) and cancer-specific survival (50.9% for surgery + RT vs 42.1% for surgery) on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, adjuvant RT (hazards ratio [HR] of 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71-0.86 [P < .001]) remained a significant predictor of improved survival. The significant benefit of radiation on overall survival was noted for lymph node-positive patients with both primary tumors localized to the involved organ (HR of 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71-0.94 [P = .007]) and more locally invasive primary tumors (HR of 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.87 [P < .001]). CONCLUSIONS: In what to the authors' knowledge is the largest reported analysis of adjuvant RT in patients with locally advanced HNSCC published to date, adjuvant RT resulted in an approximately 10% absolute increase in 5-year cancer-specific survival and overall survival for patients with lymph node-positive HNSCC compared with surgery alone. Despite combined surgery and adjuvant RT, outcomes in this high-risk population remain suboptimal, emphasizing the need for continued investigation of innovative treatment approaches.},

	abstract = {Emerging evidence has suggested that the capability of a tumor to grow and propagate is dependent on a small subset of cells within a tumor, termed cancer stem cells. Although data have been provided to support this theory in human blood, brain, and breast cancers, the identity of pancreatic cancer stem cells has not been determined. Using a xenograft model in which primary human pancreatic adenocarcinomas were grown in immunocompromised mice, we identified a highly tumorigenic subpopulation of pancreatic cancer cells expressing the cell surface markers CD44, CD24, and epithelial-specific antigen (ESA). Pancreatic cancer cells with the CD44(+)CD24(+)ESA(+) phenotype (0.2-0.8% of pancreatic cancer cells) had a 100-fold increased tumorigenic potential compared with nontumorigenic cancer cells, with 50% of animals injected with as few as 100 CD44(+)CD24(+)ESA(+) cells forming tumors that were histologically indistinguishable from the human tumors from which they originated. The enhanced ability of CD44(+)CD24(+)ESA(+) pancreatic cancer cells to form tumors was confirmed in an orthotopic pancreatic tail injection model. The CD44(+)CD24(+)ESA(+) pancreatic cancer cells showed the stem cell properties of self-renewal, the ability to produce differentiated progeny, and increased expression of the developmental signaling molecule sonic hedgehog. Identification of pancreatic cancer stem cells and further elucidation of the signaling pathways that regulate their growth and survival may provide novel therapeutic approaches to treat pancreatic cancer, which is notoriously resistant to standard chemotherapy and radiation.},

	abstract = {Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is complicated by a second primary carcinoma of the head and neck, esophagus (the upper aerodigestive tract, or UADT), or lung in 10-40% of patients. Routine panendoscopy will identify a simultaneous second primary in 9-14% of the patients. Metachronous second cancers most often involve the esophagus or lung, whereas synchronous second cancers are more common in the head and neck as occult lesions. For the highest-risk subgroups, second primary cancers occur in 4% of patients per year. In cancer of the floor of the mouth the excess mortality rate is 5-6% per year. Risk is independent of stage of the first primary and the survival impact is the greatest in groups of patients with early-stage disease. Head and neck cancer almost always results from the heavy use of tobacco for many years, either with or without the concomitant heavy use of alcohol, and these same agents are directly responsible for the second cancers of the UADT and lung. All head and neck cancer patients should be advised to avoid these agents. The clinician must diagnose and treat second cancers to extend the survival of patients with a good prognosis for control of the initial head and neck cancer. We need further progress in eliminating the use of known carcinogens in these patients, paradigms for cost-effective diagnosis and treatment of second primary cancers, effective treatment of the head and neck primary cancer devoid of long-lasting tissue toxicities, effective chemopreventive agents to retard established processes of carcinogenesis that place the patient at continued risk after cigarette and alcohol use has been eliminated, and continued efforts to control the medical illnesses to which these patients are susceptible.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To study prospectively the activity of primary chemotherapy with cisplatin, fluorouracil and leucovorin (PFL) in patients with paranasal cancer receiving surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients, previously untreated, with resectable paranasal carcinoma were enrolled. PFL (leucovorin 250 mg/m2/day for 5 days as a 120 h continuous infusion (c.i.), 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m2/day from day 2 as a 96 h c.i. and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day 2 q 3 weeks) was planned for five courses. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (65%) completed three or more chemotherapy courses. Two deaths from thrombotic events were observed after the first cycle. Eight cardiac toxicities were recorded during chemotherapy causing treatment discontinuation. Objective response to PFL was observed in 21 patients [43%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 29% to 58%], including four complete responses (CRs) (8%; 95% CI 2% to 20%) and 17 partial responses (PRs) (35%). Pathological complete remission (pCR) was achieved in eight of 49 patients (16%). At 3 years, overall survival was 69% and event-free survival 57%. Overall and event-free survival in patients achieving pCR is 100%. CONCLUSIONS: PFL is active in paranasal cancer. Patients who attain a pathological complete remission have a favorable prognosis. Cardiovascular complications represent the limiting toxicity. Primary chemotherapy combined with surgery-sparing treatment approaches deserves further investigation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: After the introduction of ICI treatment, data about feasibility and activity of a cetuximab-containing first-line therapy in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancer (R/M HNSCC) are still not available. We sought to analyze the clinical outcomes in the real-world setting. MATERIAL METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at two tertiary medical centers in Taiwan. Patients with R/M HNSCC receiving cetuximab-containing first-line therapy were included between January 2017 and July 2019. The study endpoints were the response, Progression-Free Survival (PFS), and Overall Survival (OS). Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate survival outcomes by platinum resistance and the use of immunotherapy. RESULTS: We identified 290 patients treated with cetuximab-containing first-line therapy. The most primary tumor site was oral cavity cancer (59.3%). 44% of patients were resistant to platinum. The median PFS and OS were 5.0 months and 9.1 months, respectively, for the total population. In patients with platinum resistance, the median OS was 10.4 months with ICIs versus 6.3 months without ICIs; p = 0.01. In patients with platinum sensitivity, the median OS was 20.6 months with ICIs versus 9.1 months without ICs; p < 0.01. OS benefit with ICIs was similar between patients who received ICIs after progression on Cetuximab and receiving Cetuximab in combination with ICIs. Independent favorable prognostic factors for OS were platinum-sensitive, better response to cetuximab, and ICIs use. CONCLUSION: ICIs are indicated to improve OS in R/M HNSCC receiving cetuximab-containing first-line therapy, even in platinum-resistant populations. The reduction in risk of death with ICIs was similar regarding the combination or sequencing of cetuximab.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic evidence points to a connection between viral infection by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and a subgroup of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx. To assess the impact of HPV infection on the response of these tumors toward radiotherapy, the authors retrospectively determined the presence of the virus and the integrity of the viral E2 gene in tumors of patients who have undergone curative irradiation. METHODS: Paraffin embedded biopsies from 99 patients were analyzed for HPV infection and E2 gene integrity by multiplex PCR. The experimental findings were correlated with clinical characteristics, known risk factors, and treatment outcome. RESULTS: Fourteen of 99 tumors were HPV positive (11 HPV16, 1 HPV33, 1 HPV35, and 1 HPV45). Human papillomavirus positivity was closely linked to female gender (odds ratio [OR], 5.75; P = 0.004), age older than 56 years (OR, 7.42; P = 0.012), nonsmokers (OR, 21.33; P = 0.00001), and alcohol abstainers (OR, 5.35; P = 0.012). There was an inverse association with p53 nuclear immunoreactivity (OR, 0.06; P = 0.008). The Kaplan-Meier survival estimates showed a better local control (P = 0.050, log-rank) and a better overall survival (P = 0.046, log-rank) for patients with HPV positive tumors. In the multivariate analysis, HPV positivity remained to be associated with a lower risk of local failure (risk ratio [RR], 0.31; P = 0.048). Four of 11 HPV16 positive tumors had a disrupted E2 gene. Only tumors with a disrupted E2 gene manifested local treatment failure. CONCLUSIONS: Human papillomavirus positivity designates a specific subgroup of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx that arise preferentially among individuals with no consumption of tobacco and alcohol and that have a favorable outcome attributable to an increased sensitivity toward radiotherapy.},

	abstract = {From 1970 to 2002 in the Stockholm area, we revealed a parallel three-fold increase in the incidence of tonsillar cancer and the proportion of human papillomavirus (HPV) positive tonsillar cancer cases, indicating a possible role of HPV infection in this disease. We have now examined whether HPV and viral load in pre-treatment tonsillar cancer biopsies correlates to disease prognosis, and whether the presence of HPV-16 E6 and E7 mRNA could be ascertained. The presence of HPV-16, but not viral load, in tonsillar cancer was shown to be a favourable prognostic factor for clinical outcome. Moreover, E6 and/or E7 were expressed in almost all assessable HPV-16 positive cases, supporting an oncogenic role of HPV-16 in tonsillar cancer.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of hypoxia-induced gene expression and cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression on outcome of postoperative cisplatin-based radiochemotherapy (PORT-C) in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of the CSC markers CD44, MET, and SLC3A2, and hypoxia gene signatures were analyzed in the resected primary tumors using RT-PCR and nanoString technology in a multicenter retrospective cohort of 195 patients. CD44 protein expression was further analyzed in tissue microarrays. Primary endpoint was locoregional tumor control. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that hypoxia-induced gene expression was significantly associated with a high risk of locoregional recurrence using the 15-gene signature (P = 0.010) or the 26-gene signature (P = 0.002). In multivariate analyses, in patients with HPV16 DNA-negative but not with HPV16 DNA-positive tumors the effect of hypoxia-induced genes on locoregional control was apparent (15-gene signature: HR 4.54, P = 0.006; 26-gene signature: HR 10.27, P = 0.024). Furthermore, MET, SLC3A2, CD44, and CD44 protein showed an association with locoregional tumor control in multivariate analyses (MET: HR 3.71, P = 0.016; SLC3A2: HR 8.54, P = 0.037; CD44: HR 3.36, P = 0.054; CD44 protein n/a because of no event in the CD44-negative group) in the HPV16 DNA-negative subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown for the first time that high hypoxia-induced gene expression and high CSC marker expression levels correlate with tumor recurrence after PORT-C in patients with HPV16 DNA-negative HNSCC. After validation in a currently ongoing prospective trial, these parameters may help to further stratify patients for individualized treatment de-escalation or intensification strategies.

In multivariate analyses, in patients with HPV16 DNA-negative but not with HPV16 DNA-positive tumors the effect of hypoxia-induced genes on locoregional control was apparent (15-gene signature: HR 4.54, P = 0.006; 26-gene signature: HR 10.27, P = 0.024). Furthermore, MET, SLC3A2, CD44, and CD44 protein showed an association with locoregional tumor control in multivariate analyses (MET: HR 3.71, P = 0.016; SLC3A2: HR 8.54, P = 0.037; CD44: HR 3.36, P = 0.054; CD44 protein n/a because of no event in the CD44-negative group) in the HPV16 DNA-negative subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown for the first time that high hypoxia-induced gene expression and high CSC marker expression levels correlate with tumor recurrence after PORT-C in patients with HPV16 DNA-negative HNSCC. After validation in a currently ongoing prospective trial, these parameters may help to further stratify patients for individualized treatment de-escalation or intensification strategies.

	abstract = {Objective: To validate the impact of HPV status, cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression and tumour hypoxia status in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), who received postoperative radiotherapy. The results of the exploration cohort have previously been reported by the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG; Lohaus et al., 2014; Linge et al., 2016). Materials and methods: For 152 patients with locally advanced HNSCC the impact of HPV16 DNA status, CSC marker expression and hypoxia-associated gene signatures on outcome of postoperative radiotherapy were retrospectively analysed. Out of them, 40 patients received postoperative radiochemotherapy. Cox models presented in a previous study were validated using the concordance index as a performance measure. The primary endpoint of this study was loco-regional control. Results were compared to those previously reported by DKTK-ROG. Results: Loco-regional control, freedom from distant metastases and overall survival were inferior to the previously reported cohort. Despite of this, the prognostic value of the combination of HPV infection status, CSC marker expression (SLC3A2) and tumour hypoxia status could be validated in univariate analyses using an independent validation cohort. For multivariate models, the concordance index was between 0.58 and 0.69 in validation, indicating a good prognostic performance of the models. The inclusion of CD44 and the 15-gene hypoxia signature moderately improved the performance compared to a baseline model without CSC markers or hypoxia classifiers. Conclusions: The HPV status, CSC marker expression of CD44 and SLC3A2 as well as hypoxia status are potential prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced HNSCC treated by postoperative radiotherapy.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 158 patients with locally advanced HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx or hypopharynx who were treated at six DKTK partner sites, the impact of tumour volume, HPV DNA, p16 overexpression, p53 expression, CSC marker expression and hypoxia-associated gene signatures on outcome of primary RCTx was retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint of this study was loco-regional control (LRC). RESULTS: Univariate Cox regression revealed a significant impact of tumour volume, p16 overexpression, and SLC3A2 and CD44 protein expression on LRC. The tumour hypoxia classification showed a significant impact only for small tumours. In multivariate analyses an independent correlation of tumour volume, SLC3A2 expression, and the 15-gene hypoxia signature with LRC was identified (CD44 protein n/a because of no event in the CD44-negative group). Logistic modelling showed that inclusion of CD44 protein expression and p16 overexpression significantly improved the performance to predict LRC at 2years compared to the model with tumour volume alone. CONCLUSIONS: Tumour volume, HPV status, CSC marker expression and hypoxia gene signatures are potential prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced HNSCC, who were treated by primary RCTx. The study also supports that the individual tumour volumes should generally be included in biomarker studies and that panels of biomarkers are superior to individual parameters.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the tumour volume, HPV status, cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression and hypoxia gene signatures, as potential markers of radiobiological mechanisms of radioresistance, in a contemporary cohort of patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), who received primary radiochemotherapy (RCTx). MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 158 patients with locally advanced HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx or hypopharynx who were treated at six DKTK partner sites, the impact of tumour volume, HPV DNA, p16 overexpression, p53 expression, CSC marker expression and hypoxia-associated gene signatures on outcome of primary RCTx was retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint of this study was loco-regional control (LRC). RESULTS: Univariate Cox regression revealed a significant impact of tumour volume, p16 overexpression, and SLC3A2 and CD44 protein expression on LRC. The tumour hypoxia classification showed a significant impact only for small tumours. In multivariate analyses an independent correlation of tumour volume, SLC3A2 expression, and the 15-gene hypoxia signature with LRC was identified (CD44 protein n/a because of no event in the CD44-negative group). Logistic modelling showed that inclusion of CD44 protein expression and p16 overexpression significantly improved the performance to predict LRC at 2years compared to the model with tumour volume alone. CONCLUSIONS: Tumour volume, HPV status, CSC marker expression and hypoxia gene signatures are potential prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced HNSCC, who were treated by primary RCTx. The study also supports that the individual tumour volumes should generally be included in biomarker studies and that panels of biomarkers are superior to individual parameters.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of hypoxia-induced gene expression and cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression on outcome of postoperative cisplatin-based radiochemotherapy (PORT-C) in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of the CSC markers CD44, MET, and SLC3A2, and hypoxia gene signatures were analyzed in the resected primary tumors using RT-PCR and nanoString technology in a multicenter retrospective cohort of 195 patients. CD44 protein expression was further analyzed in tissue microarrays. Primary endpoint was locoregional tumor control. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that hypoxia-induced gene expression was significantly associated with a high risk of locoregional recurrence using the 15-gene signature (P = 0.010) or the 26-gene signature (P = 0.002). In multivariate analyses, in patients with HPV16 DNA-negative but not with HPV16 DNA-positive tumors the effect of hypoxia-induced genes on locoregional control was apparent (15-gene signature: HR 4.54, P = 0.006; 26-gene signature: HR 10.27, P = 0.024). Furthermore, MET, SLC3A2, CD44, and CD44 protein showed an association with locoregional tumor control in multivariate analyses (MET: HR 3.71, P = 0.016; SLC3A2: HR 8.54, P = 0.037; CD44: HR 3.36, P = 0.054; CD44 protein n/a because of no event in the CD44-negative group) in the HPV16 DNA-negative subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown for the first time that high hypoxia-induced gene expression and high CSC marker expression levels correlate with tumor recurrence after PORT-C in patients with HPV16 DNA-negative HNSCC. After validation in a currently ongoing prospective trial, these parameters may help to further stratify patients for individualized treatment de-escalation or intensification strategies.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To validate the impact of HPV status, cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression and tumour hypoxia status in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), who received postoperative radiotherapy. The results of the exploration cohort have previously been reported by the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG; Lohaus et al., 2014; Linge et al., 2016). MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 152 patients with locally advanced HNSCC the impact of HPV16 DNA status, CSC marker expression and hypoxia-associated gene signatures on outcome of postoperative radiotherapy were retrospectively analysed. Out of them, 40 patients received postoperative radiochemotherapy. Cox models presented in a previous study were validated using the concordance index as a performance measure. The primary endpoint of this study was loco-regional control. Results were compared to those previously reported by DKTK-ROG. RESULTS: Loco-regional control, freedom from distant metastases and overall survival were inferior to the previously reported cohort. Despite of this, the prognostic value of the combination of HPV infection status, CSC marker expression (SLC3A2) and tumour hypoxia status could be validated in univariate analyses using an independent validation cohort. For multivariate models, the concordance index was between 0.58 and 0.69 in validation, indicating a good prognostic performance of the models. The inclusion of CD44 and the 15-gene hypoxia signature moderately improved the performance compared to a baseline model without CSC markers or hypoxia classifiers. CONCLUSIONS: The HPV status, CSC marker expression of CD44 and SLC3A2 as well as hypoxia status are potential prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced HNSCC treated by postoperative radiotherapy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To independently validate the impact of tumour volume, p16 status, cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression and hypoxia-associated gene signatures as potential prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), who underwent primary radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy (RCTx). These markers have previously been reported in a study of the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG) (Linge et al., 2016). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective monocentric study, 92 patients with locally advanced HNSCC were included. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions and Cox models presented in the study of the DKTK-ROG were validated using the area under the curve (AUC) and the concordance index (ci), respectively. The primary endpoint of this study was loco-regional tumour control (LRC) after primary RCTx. RESULTS: Although both cohorts significantly differed in the proportion of the tumour subsites, the parameters tumour volume, p16 status and N stage could be validated regarding LRC and overall survival (OS) using multivariable Cox regression (LRC ci: 0.59, OS ci: 0.63). These models were slightly improved by combination with the putative CSC marker CD44 (LRC ci: 0.61, OS ci: 0.69). The logistic regression model for 2-year LRC based on tumour volume, p16 status and CD44 protein was validated with an AUC of 0.64. The patient stratification based on hypoxia-associated gene signatures status was similar to the original study but without significant differences in LRC and OS. CONCLUSIONS: In this validation study, the inclusion of the putative CSC marker CD44 slightly improved the prognostic performance of the baseline parameters tumour volume, p16 status and N stage. No improvement was observed when including expressions of the hypoxia-associated gene signatures. Prospective validation on a larger cohort is warranted to assess the clinical relevance of these markers.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare six HPV detection methods in pre-treatment FFPE tumour samples from patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who received postoperative (N=175) or primary (N=90) radiochemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HPV analyses included detection of (i) HPV16 E6/E7 RNA, (ii) HPV16 DNA (PCR-based arrays, A-PCR), (iii) HPV DNA (GP5+/GP6+ qPCR, (GP-PCR)), (iv) p16 (immunohistochemistry, p16 IHC), (v) combining p16 IHC and the A-PCR result and (vi) combining p16 IHC and the GP-PCR result. Differences between HPV positive and negative subgroups were evaluated for the primary endpoint loco-regional control (LRC) using Cox regression. RESULTS: Correlation between the HPV detection methods was high (chi-squared test, p<0.001). While p16 IHC analysis resulted in several false positive classifications, A-PCR, GP-PCR and the combination of p16 IHC and A-PCR or GP-PCR led to results comparable to RNA analysis. In both cohorts, Cox regression analyses revealed significantly prolonged LRC for patients with HPV positive tumours irrespective of the detection method. CONCLUSIONS: The most stringent classification was obtained by detection of HPV16 RNA, or combining p16 IHC with A-PCR or GP-PCR. This approach revealed the lowest rate of recurrence in patients with tumours classified as HPV positive and therefore appears most suited for patient stratification in HPV-based clinical studies.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 221 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx, oropharynx or oral cavity treated at the 8 partner sites of the German Cancer Consortium, the impact of HPV DNA, p16 overexpression and p53 expression on outcome were retrospectively analysed. The primary endpoint was loco-regional tumour control; secondary endpoints were distant metastases and overall survival. RESULTS: In the total patient population, univariate analyses revealed a significant impact of HPV16 DNA positivity, p16 overexpression, p53 positivity and tumour site on loco-regional tumour control. Multivariate analysis stratified for tumour site showed that positive HPV 16 DNA status correlated with loco-regional tumour control in patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma (p=0.02) but not in the oral cavity carcinoma group. Multivariate evaluation of the secondary endpoints in the total population revealed a significant association of HPV16 DNA positivity with overall survival (p<0.01) but not with distant metastases.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prospective data on alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking and risk of head-neck cancer (HNC) subtypes, i.e. oral cavity cancer (OCC), oro-/hypopharyngeal cancer (OHPC), and laryngeal cancer (LC), are limited. We investigated these associations within the second largest prospective study on this topic so far, the Netherlands Cohort Study. METHODS: 120,852 participants completed a questionnaire on diet and other cancer risk factors in 1986. After 17.3 years of follow-up, 395 HNC (110 OCC, 83 OHPC, and 199 LC) cases and 4288 subcohort members were available for case-cohort analysis using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: For total HNC, the multivariable adjusted incidence rate ratio (RR) was 2.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85-4.06) for those drinking ≥30 g ethanol/day compared with abstainers; in subtypes, RRs were 6.39 for OCC, 3.52 for OHPC, and 1.54 for LC. Compared with never cigarette smokers, current cigarette smokers had a RR of 4.49 (95%CI 3.11-6.48) for HNC overall, and 2.11 for OCC, 8.53 for OHPC, and 8.07 for LC. A significant, positive, multiplicative interaction between categories of alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking was found for HNC overall (P interaction 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking were independently associated with risk of HNC overall, with a positive, multiplicative interaction. The strength of these associations differed among HNC-subtypes: OCC was most strongly associated with alcohol consumption but most weakly with cigarette smoking, whereas LC was not statistically significantly associated with alcohol consumption.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: CD44 splice variants are long-known as being associated with cell transformation. Recently, the standard form of CD44 (CD44s) was shown to be part of the signature of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in colon, breast, and in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). This is somewhat in contradiction to previous reports on the expression of CD44s in HNSCC. The aim of the present study was to clarify the actual pattern of CD44 expression in head and neck epithelia. METHODS: Expression of CD44s and CD44v6 was analysed by immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies in primary head and neck tissues. Scoring of all specimens followed a two-parameters system, which implemented percentages of positive cells and staining intensities from - to +++ (score = % x intensity; resulting max. score 300). In addition, cell surface expression of CD44s and CD44v6 was assessed in lymphocytes and HNSCC. RESULTS: In normal epithelia CD44s and CD44v6 were expressed in 60-95% and 50-80% of cells and yielded mean scores with a standard error of a mean (SEM) of 249.5+/-14.5 and 198+/-11.13, respectively. In oral leukoplakia and in moderately differentiated carcinomas CD44s and CD44v6 levels were slightly increased (278.9+/-7.16 and 242+/-11.7; 291.8+/-5.88 and 287.3+/-6.88). Carcinomas in situ displayed unchanged levels of both proteins whereas poorly differentiated carcinomas consistently expressed diminished CD44s and CD44v6 levels. Lymphocytes and HNSCC lines strongly expressed CD44s but not CD44v6. CONCLUSION: CD44s and CD44v6 expression does not distinguish normal from benign or malignant epithelia of the head and neck. CD44s and CD44v6 were abundantly present in the great majority of cells in head and neck tissues, including carcinomas. Hence, the value of CD44s as a marker for the definition of a small subset of cells (i.e. less than 10%) representing head and neck cancer stem cells may need revision.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: CD44 splice variants are long-known as being associated with cell transformation. Recently, the standard form of CD44 (CD44s) was shown to be part of the signature of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in colon, breast, and in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). This is somewhat in contradiction to previous reports on the expression of CD44s in HNSCC. The aim of the present study was to clarify the actual pattern of CD44 expression in head and neck epithelia. METHODS: Expression of CD44s and CD44v6 was analysed by immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies in primary head and neck tissues. Scoring of all specimens followed a two-parameters system, which implemented percentages of positive cells and staining intensities from - to +++ (score = % x intensity; resulting max. score 300). In addition, cell surface expression of CD44s and CD44v6 was assessed in lymphocytes and HNSCC. RESULTS: In normal epithelia CD44s and CD44v6 were expressed in 60-95% and 50-80% of cells and yielded mean scores with a standard error of a mean (SEM) of 249.5+/-14.5 and 198+/-11.13, respectively. In oral leukoplakia and in moderately differentiated carcinomas CD44s and CD44v6 levels were slightly increased (278.9+/-7.16 and 242+/-11.7; 291.8+/-5.88 and 287.3+/-6.88). Carcinomas in situ displayed unchanged levels of both proteins whereas poorly differentiated carcinomas consistently expressed diminished CD44s and CD44v6 levels. Lymphocytes and HNSCC lines strongly expressed CD44s but not CD44v6. CONCLUSION: CD44s and CD44v6 expression does not distinguish normal from benign or malignant epithelia of the head and neck. CD44s and CD44v6 were abundantly present in the great majority of cells in head and neck tissues, including carcinomas. Hence, the value of CD44s as a marker for the definition of a small subset of cells (i.e. less than 10%) representing head and neck cancer stem cells may need revision.},

	abstract = {Eight cases of lymphoepithelial carcinoma (LEC) of the larynx and hypopharynx were evaluated for clinicopathologic features, and the presence of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and p53 alterations. The seven men and one woman, all of non-Asian descent, averaged 64 years of age. Eighty-eight percent had histologically confirmed cervical lymph node metastasis at diagnosis. None had systemic disease. Seven of eight patients available for follow-up (mean, 17.7 months) were alive and free of disease, although one did develop recurrent tumor in the neck. Four tumors were composed, histologically, of pure LEC. Four others had foci of both LEC and conventional squamous cell carcinoma. All eight tumors exhibited alterations in p53 expression, but none was positive for EBV. Combining these 8 cases with the 15 previously published cases in the English literature indicate that LEC in this site is a rare, rather aggressive tumor, primarily of older adults (mean, 62 years) with a propensity for early cervical lymph node metastasis and eventual distant dissemination and death from disease in about one third of patients. Although p53 alterations are common and of no apparent prognostic significance, LEC at this site seems to have little, if any, relationship to the EBV in patients of non-Asian origin.},

	abstract = {Although CD133 has been shown to be a marker for cancer stem cells in various tumours, its expression in pancreatic cancer has not yet been clinically reported. In this study, we investigated the relationship between CD133 expression and clinicopathological factors in pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic head carcinoma specimens from 80 patients who underwent surgical resection were immunohistochemically assessed for CD133, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C, CXCR4, CD34, Ki-67, and cytokeratin (CK) expressions. Sixty percentage (48/80) of specimens were CD133-positive, with less than 15% cells per specimen expressing the marker. CD133-positive cells were found at the peripheral site of adenocarcinoma glandular structures and were negative for CK. There was a significant correlation between CD133 expression and clinicopathological factors, including histological type, lymphatic invasion, and lymph node metastasis (P=0.0215, 0.0023, and 0.0024, respectively). Vascular endothelial growth factor-C expression was also significantly correlated with CD133 expression (P=0.0002). Consequently, the 5-year survival rate of CD133-positive patients was significantly lower than that of CD133-negative patients (P=0.0002) and multivariate analysis revealed that CD133 expression was an independent prognostic factor (P=0.0103). These results suggest that CD133 expression in pancreatic cancer was significantly associated with lymphatic metastasis, VEGF-C expression, and prognosis.},

	abstract = {A rise in incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer--specifically of the lingual and palatine tonsils--in white men younger than age 50 years who have no history of alcohol or tobacco use has been recorded over the past decade. This malignant disease is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 infection. The biology of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer is distinct with P53 degradation, retinoblastoma RB pathway inactivation, and P16 upregulation. By contrast, tobacco-related oropharyngeal cancer is characterised by TP53 mutation and downregulation of CDKN2A (encoding P16). The best method to detect virus in tumour is controversial, and both in-situ hybridisation and PCR are commonly used; P16 immunohistochemistry could serve as a potential surrogate marker. HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer seems to be more responsive to chemotherapy and radiation than HPV-negative disease. HPV 16 is a prognostic marker for enhanced overall and disease-free survival, but its use as a predictive marker has not yet been proven. Many questions about the natural history of oral HPV infection remain under investigation. For example, why does the increase in HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer dominate in men? What is the potential of HPV vaccines for primary prevention? Could an accurate method to detect HPV in tumour be developed? Which treatment strategies reduce toxic effects without compromising survival? Our aim with this review is to highlight current understanding of the epidemiology, biology, detection, and management of HPV-related oropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and to describe unresolved issues.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clearance of surgical margins at the primary site is widely thought to influence the subsequent course of the disease in patients operated on for oral and oropharyngeal carcinoma. In some reports the adverse impact of close or involved margins was not negated by postoperative radiotherapy. These findings, in addition to descriptive histopathological studies, have led some authors to recommend margins of more than a macroscopic clearance of 1cm at certain subsites. We have therefore examined the relation between the condition of surgical margins and local recurrence and disease-specific survival. METHODS: Identical treatment protocols were used to treat two independent groups of patients (Sydney, Australia, n=237; Lanarkshire, n=95) who presented with previously untreated carcinoma of the mouth or oropharynx. All patients were operated on with the primary objective of achieving a macroscopic clearance of 1cm. Postoperative radiotherapy was used according to a protocol. Data about patients were entered into comprehensive computerised databases prospectively. Known clinical and pathological prognostic indicators, in addition to the condition of surgical margins, were analysed to find out if they were predictive of local recurrence and disease-specific survival using the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Local recurrence was predicted by the presence of perineural invasion at the primary site in both groups. Disease-specific survival was predicted by the presence and extent of regional lymph node metastases in both groups. The condition of surgical margins (clear, close, or involved) did not predict local recurrence, or disease-specific survival on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A macroscopic margin of 1cm seems adequate in the surgical management of oral and oropharyngeal carcinoma. For most patients who have close or involved margins the biology of the disease influences the subsequent course irrespective of the width of clearance of tumour.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of image-guided surveillance as compared with planned neck dissection in the treatment of patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck who have advanced nodal disease (stage N2 or N3) and who have received chemoradiotherapy for primary treatment is a matter of debate. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we assessed the noninferiority of positron-emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT)-guided surveillance (performed 12 weeks after the end of chemoradiotherapy, with neck dissection performed only if PET-CT showed an incomplete or equivocal response) to planned neck dissection in patients with stage N2 or N3 disease. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: From 2007 through 2012, we recruited 564 patients (282 patients in the planned-surgery group and 282 patients in the surveillance group) from 37 centers in the United Kingdom. Among these patients, 17% had nodal stage N2a disease and 61% had stage N2b disease. A total of 84% of the patients had oropharyngeal cancer, and 75% had tumor specimens that stained positive for the p16 protein, an indicator that human papillomavirus had a role in the causation of the cancer. The median follow-up was 36 months. PET-CT-guided surveillance resulted in fewer neck dissections than did planned dissection surgery (54 vs. 221); rates of surgical complications were similar in the two groups (42% and 38%, respectively). The 2-year overall survival rate was 84.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80.7 to 89.1) in the surveillance group and 81.5% (95% CI, 76.9 to 86.3) in the planned-surgery group. The hazard ratio for death slightly favored PET-CT-guided surveillance and indicated noninferiority (upper boundary of the 95% CI for the hazard ratio, <1.50; P=0.004). There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to p16 expression. Quality of life was similar in the two groups. PET-CT-guided surveillance, as compared with neck dissection, resulted in savings of £1,492 (approximately $2,190 in U.S. dollars) per person over the duration of the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Survival was similar among patients who underwent PET-CT-guided surveillance and those who underwent planned neck dissection, but surveillance resulted in considerably fewer operations and it was more cost-effective.

	abstract = {A rapidly increasing number of genes are being suspected to play a role in cancer biology. To evaluate the clinical significance of newly detected potential cancer genes, it is usually required to examine a high number of well-characterized primary tumors. Using traditional methods of molecular pathology, this is a time consuming endeavor rapidly exhausting precious tissue resources. To allow for a high throughput tissue analysis we have developed a "tissue chip" approach (Kononen et al., Nat. Med. 1998;4:844-7). Using this tissue microarray (TMA) technology, samples from up to 1,000 different tumors are arrayed in one recipient paraffin block, sections of which can be used for all kind of in situ analyses. Section from TMA blocks can then be utilized for the simultaneous analysis of up to 1,000 different tumors on the DNA, RNA or protein level. TMAs allow a high throughput molecular analysis of thousands of tumors within a few hours. All currently available data have suggested that minute arrayed tissue specimens are highly representative of their donor tissues. There are multiple different types of TMAs that can be utilized in cancer research including multi tumor arrays (containing different tumor types), tumor progression arrays (tumors of different stages) and prognostic arrays (tumors with clinical endpoints). The combination of multiple different TMAs allows a very quick but comprehensive characterization of biomarkers of interest. We anticipate that the use of TMAs will greatly accelerate the transition of basic research findings to clinical applications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that tumor thickness might influence prognosis in oral cancer, but the significant point at which outcome changes has varied from 1.5 mm to 6 mm. The clinical relevance of thickness remains unclear, and a reproducible prognostic "breakpoint" needs to be defined. METHODS: Tumor thickness was measured in 145 oral cavity squamous cancers, clinically staged T1 (n = 62) or T2 (n = 83). Clinical and pathologic data were collected prospectively between 1988 and 2000, but thickness was measured on paraffin sections for this study. Minimum follow-up was 2 years, and thickness was correlated with local control, cervical node involvement, and survival. Patients with clinically positive nodes (n = 21) were not excluded. Overall, 55 patients had pathologic node involvement at some time in their disease. RESULTS: Median tumor thickness was 6.2 mm, and there was little variation between sites: tongue, 6.4 mm; floor of mouth, 6.6 mm; and other sites, 5.7 mm. Median thickness for T1 tumors was 4.3 mm, significantly less than the T2 group, 8 mm (p <.01). Median thickness also varied significantly for tumors with associated nodal disease (8.5 mm) and without nodal disease (5.8 mm) (p <.01). Prognosis changed significantly at a cutoff of 4 mm with local control, nodal disease, and survival rates of 91%, 8%, and 100%, respectively, for tumors <4 mm compared with 84%, 48%, and 74% for those 4 mm or more thick (p <.01). Subgrouping greater than and less than 3 mm and 5 mm also showed a difference but with poorer discrimination. Thickness and pathologic nodal involvement were highly significant independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor thickness is a highly significant, objectively measurable prognostic factor in early stage oral cancers. There is a need to standardize techniques of measurement to allow a multi-institutional study to be carried out. This will facilitate the development of strategies aimed at improving the outcome of higher risk patients.},

We used surgical specimens of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from 101 patients. In view of tumor heterogeneity, we randomly selected 10 high-power fields per case, and triple-positive CD44(+) /CD24(+) /EpCAM(+) expression was identified using our scoring system. The distribution, histological characteristics, and prognostic importance of CD44(+) /CD24(+) /EpCAM(+) cells were then analyzed. As a result, the distribution of CD44(+) /CD24(+) /EpCAM(+) cells varied widely among the 101 cases examined, and CD44(+) /CD24(+) /EpCAM(+) expression was correlated with poor glandular differentiation and high proliferation. Survival analysis showed that CD44(+) /CD24(+) /EpCAM(+) expression was not correlated with patient outcome; however, CD44(+) /CD24(+) expression appeared to be correlated with poor prognosis. In conclusion, CD44(+) /CD24(+) /EpCAM(+) expression overlapped with poorly differentiated cells and possessed high proliferative potential in clinical pancreatic cancer. In particular, the presence of double-positive CD44(+) /CD24(+) expression seemed to have clinical relevance, associating with poor prognosis.},

We aimed to find out whether shortening of treatment time by use of six instead of five radiotherapy fractions per week improves the tumour response in squamous-cell carcinoma. METHODS: We did a multicentre, controlled, randomised trial. Between January, 1992, and December, 1999, of 1485 patients treated with primary radiotherapy alone, 1476 eligible patients were randomly assigned five (n=726) or six (n=750) fractions per week at the same total dose and fraction number (66-68 Gy in 33-34 fractions to all tumour sites except well-differentiated T1 glottic tumours, which were treated with 62 Gy). All patients, except those with glottic cancers, also received the hypoxic radiosensitiser nimorazole. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: More than 97% of the patients received the planned total dose. Median overall treatment times were 39 days (six-fraction group) and 46 days (five-fraction group). Overall 5-year locoregional control rates were 70% and 60% for the six-fraction and five-fraction groups, respectively (p=0.0005). The whole benefit of shortening of treatment time was seen for primary tumour control (76 vs 64% for six and five fractions, p=0.0001), but was non-significant for neck-node control. Six compared with five fractions per week improved preservation of the voice among patients with laryngeal cancer (80 vs 68%, p=0.007). Disease-specific survival improved (73 vs 66% for six and five fractions, p=0.01) but not overall survival. Acute morbidity was significantly more frequent with six than with five fractions, but was transient.

	abstract = {AIMS: To improve the interpretation of immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining results the use of a tissue microarray technique was established in a routine setting. METHODS: A tissue microarray was constructed by harvesting 600 microm tissue cores from paraffin wax embedded samples available in a routine pathology department. The punches originating from non-tumorous tissue were placed on host paraffin wax blocks. The microarray contained 12 different tissue samples, with a wide antigen profile and a dimension of 3.5 x 3 mm. One section of the multitissue array was placed as an "internal" positive control on each slide of the patient tissue to undergo identical immunohistochemical procedures. RESULTS: Using the tissue microarray technique as a tool for internal quality control, the interpretation of immunohistochemical staining of more than 20 different antigens in routine IHC was improved. The tissue microarray did not influence the staining results in conventional IHC or in different automated IHC settings. CONCLUSION: The regular use of an institution adapted tissue microarray would be useful for internal positive control in IHC to enable different laboratory demands. Furthermore, this technique improves the evaluation of staining results in IHC.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Laser therapy is becoming a more precise, minimally invasive alternative for tumor ablation. Recent reports confirm successful palliation of pain and functional disabilities in patients with advanced deep carcinoma of the head and neck using interstitial laser phototherapy (ILT). STUDY DESIGN, PATIENTS, AND METHODS: The current study describes an ongoing Phase II trial of neodymium/yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser therapy for palliation of advanced head and neck cancer. A total of 40 advanced cancer patients have been entered into this protocol (25 men and 15 women). RESULTS: Nineteen of these patients had no evidence of recurrence after ILT with an average follow-up of 11 months (range, 2 to 24 mo). Currently, 19 of these patients are alive, 14 with tumor remission and six with persistent disease. A total of 79 tumor sites received ILT with 43 (54.5%) completely ablated. Stratified by tumor site, ILT led to a complete response in 21 of 24 in the oral cavity, eight of 28 neck tumors, four of 10 in skin, and 10 of 17 in other sites. The procedure was well tolerated in most cases and was repeated at intervals in patients with residual disease or recurrences for a total of 118 laser treatments (average, 2.95 treatments per patient). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that ILT can be performed safely and repeated as needed, and may be less costly than conventional surgery for head and neck cancer. However, additional follow-up is needed to obtain convincing evidence of long-term therapeutic benefits.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The conventional treatment for patients with upper airway obstruction secondary to malignancy is a tracheostomy. Although this effectively resolves the problem, a tracheostomy can be associated with complications and is irreversible in most patients. An alternative is to debulk part of the tumor causing airway obstruction to maintain the airway until the definitive procedure. METHODS: The clinical course of 43 patients who underwent laser debulking for airway obstruction caused by laryngeal or hypopharyngeal malignancies was retrospectively studied. We present our technique of laser debulking and the efficacy of the procedure in avoiding a tracheostomy. RESULTS: Fourteen patients who underwent this procedure received palliative treatment only. The number of debulking procedures per patient ranged from one to six, with a mean of 1.9 episodes. Although these patients had a higher comorbid burden, none were thought unsuitable for the procedure. A tracheostomy was avoided in 91% of patients. No laser-related complications were encountered. CONCLUSIONS: Laser debulking is a viable alternative to tracheostomy in patients with malignant upper airway obstruction.},

@article{RN82,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Certain strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) have been shown to be etiologically related to the development of uterine cervical and other genital cancers, but their role in the development of malignancies at other sites is less well established. Previous studies have shown HPV DNA in tumors of the head and neck, but its prevalence has varied depending on the detection methods and the types of tumor and/or tissue examined. This study was undertaken to estimate the frequency of HPV DNA in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) at different sites of the esophagus, head and neck and to compare the clinical behavior of HPV positive and negative tumors. METHODS: DNA was extracted from frozen tissue of 167 SCCs of the esophagus, head and neck. The DNA was screened for HPV sequences by polymerase chain reaction with two sets of consensus primers, one to a conserved region in the L1 gene (MY09/ MY11) and the other to a conserved region in the E1 open reading frame (IU/IWDO). The products were run on agarose gels, detected by ethidium bromide staining, and then the gels were subjected to Southern blot analysis and hybridized with probes specific to HPV 6, 16, and 18. All tumors found to be HPV positive with the consensus primers were amplified with type specific primers, and in selected cases the presence of HPV DNA was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion of the tumor DNA with conventional Southern blot analysis. RESULTS: Overall, HPV sequences were found in 25 of 167 tumors (15%), but HPV was detected most frequently in tumors in Waldeyer's tonsillar ring. In that area, 9 of 15 (60%) were HPV positive. No HPV DNA was detected in 11 esophageal SCCs, 7 tumors of the pharynx/hypopharynx, or 6 pyriform sinus carcinomas. HPV DNA was detected in the following tumor sites: 1 of 28 (3.6%) in the larynx, 1 of 10 (10%) in the oral cavity, 5 of 39 (12.8%) in the tongue, 2 of 15 (13.5%) in the floor of the mouth, 3 of 21 (14.3%) supraglottic, and 1 of 7 (14.3%) in the lip. A high incidence of HPV DNA was also found in metastatic tumors located in cervical lymph nodes for which no primary site was clinically identified (3 of 8, 37.5%). With respect to age, gender, and tobacco and alcohol consumption, analysis of clinical data obtained by retrospective review showed no difference between patients with HPV DNA in their tumors and those in which no HPV was detected. However, HPV positive patients had larger tumors (P = 0.09) and a higher incidence of lymph node metastasis (P = 0.003). In spite of the higher stage of disease at presentation in HPV positive patients, there was no significant difference in 3-year survival rates between HPV positive patients and HPV negative patients (43.1% vs. 48.8%, respectively). Median follow-up was 27 months. CONCLUSIONS: In the head and neck, HPV-associated SCC had site specificity with the viral DNA frequently found in tumors in Waldeyer's tonsillar ring. Patients with HPV positive tumors presented with a higher stage of disease than patients with HPV negative tumors, but there was no significant difference in the 3-year survival rates between these two groups of patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine in a prospective randomized trial the optimal dose of conventionally fractionated postoperative radiotherapy for advanced head and neck cancer in relation to clinical and pathologic risk factors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 1983 and March 1991, 302 patients were enrolled on the study. This analysis is based on the first 240 patients entered through September 1989, of whom 221 (92%) had AJC Stage III or IV cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. The patients were stratified by postulated risk factors and randomized to one of three dose levels ranging between 52.2 Gy and 68.4 Gy, all given in daily doses of 1.8 Gy. Patients receiving > 57.6 Gy had a field reduction at this dose level such that boosts were only given to sites of increased risk. RESULTS: The overall crude and actuarial 2-year local-regional recurrence rates were 25.4% and 26%, respectively. Patients who received a dose of < or = 54 Gy had a significantly higher primary failure rate than those receiving > or = 57.6 Gy (p = 0.02). No significant dose response could be demonstrated above 57.6 Gy except for patients with extracapsular nodal disease in the neck in whom the recurrence rate was significantly higher at 57.6 Gy than at > or = 63 Gy. Analysis of prognostic factors predictive of local-regional recurrence showed that the only variable of independent significance was extracapsular nodal disease. However, clusters of two or more of the following risk factors were associated with a progressively increased risk of recurrence: oral cavity primary, mucosal margins close or positive, nerve invasion, > or = 2 positive lymph nodes, largest node > 3 cm, treatment delay greater than 6 weeks, and Zubrod performance status > or = 2. Moderate to severe complications of combined treatment occurred in 7.1% of patients; these were more frequent in patients who received > or = 63 Gy. CONCLUSION: With daily fractions of 1.7 Gy, a minimum tumor dose of 57.6 Gy to the whole operative bed should be delivered with a boost of 63 Gy being given to sites of increased risk, especially regions of the neck where extracapsular nodal disease is present. Treatment should be started as soon as possible after surgery. Dose escalation above 63 Gy at 1.8 Gy per day does not appear to improve the therapeutic ratio.},

	abstract = {DEFINITION: Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) origin refers to patients who present with histologicaly confirmed metastatic cancer in whom a detailed medical history, complete physical examination, including pelvic and rectal examination, full blood count and biochemistry, urinalysis and stool occult blood testing, hisinpathological review oJ biopsy speimens with the use of immunohistochemistry, chest radiography, computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, and in certain cases mammography, fail to identify the primary site. EPIDEMIOLOGY OF CUP: The cancer of unknown primary accounts for 3%-5% of all human cancers. DIAGNOSIS OF CUP: The standard diagnostic procedure for the majority of patients includes histopathologic review of biopsy specimens with the use of immunoltistochemistry, chest radiography, computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, and in certain cases mamography, fail to identify the abdomen and pelvis. The four common histologic diagnoses are: adenocarcinoma (70%), poorly differentiated carcinoma (20%), squamous carcinoma (10%), and poorly differentiated neoplasms (5%). PROGNOSIS OF CUP: The prognosis for most patients with unknown primary tumors is poor, with survival often less than 6 months from diagnosis. THERAPY OF CUP: Based on clinical and pathologic features, approximately 40% of patients can be categorized within subsets for which specific treatment has been defined. Empiric therapy is an option for the remaining 60% of patients. CONCLUSION: Metastatic tumors of unknown origin have a unique clinical presentation due to a specific biology. Insight into the molecular biology of unknown primary tumors will be essential for the development of more effective treatments.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate dose concepts in postoperative irradiation of carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract according to the radicality of resection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, the charts of 257 patients with histologically-proven carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract (40 T1, 80 T2, 53 T3, 84 T4 tumors, with nodal involvement in 181 cases) were reviewed according to the radicality of resection and dose of irradiation administered. Sixty-four patients had tumor-free resection margins (> 3 mm), 66 patients had close resection margins (< 3 mm), and 101 patients had R1 resections, and 26 patients had R2 resections. A median dose of 56 Gy was applied to the primary tumor bed and the cervical lymphatics (2 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions/week). In cases of R1 or R2 resection, or of close margins (< 3 mm), the tumor bed or, respectively, tumor residuals were boosted with doses up to a median of 66 Gy. Locoregional tumor control and survival was investigated by uni- and multivariate analyses according to T-, N-stage, grade of resection, total dose of radiation, and presence or absence of extracapsular tumor spread and lymphangiosis carcinomatosa. RESULTS: An overall 3- and 5-year survival rate of 60% and 45%, respectively, was achieved. Rates for freedom from locoregional recurrence were 77% and 72% at 3 and 5 years, respectively. The survival rates according to the grade of resection at 5 years were 67% for patients resected with tumor-free margins, 59% for patients resected with close margins, 26% for patients with R1 resection, and 27% for patients with R2 resection. Within a median follow-up period of 4.7 years for living patients, a total of 67 recurrences (26%) were observed (in 9% of patients resected with tumor-free margins, in 27% with close margins, in 37% of R1 resected, and in 19% of R2 resected patients). Freedom from locoregional recurrence at 3 years was achieved in 100% of the patients resected with tumor-free margins, in 92% of patients resected with close surgical margins, in 87% of R1 and 69% of R2 resected patients. In multivariate Cox-regression analysis, the variables grade of resection (p = 0.00031) and total dose of irradiation (p = 0.0046) were found as factors influencing locoregional control. Variables influencing survival according to multivariate analysis are T-stage (p = 0.0057), N-stage (p = 0.024), grade of resection (p = 0.000015), total dose of irradiation (p < 0. 000000). Extracapsular tumor spread and lymphangiosis carcinomatosa are factors of borderline significance (p = 0.055, p = 0.066). CONCLUSION: In postoperative radiotherapy of head and neck carcinomas, doses adapted to the risk of locoregional recurrent disease should be applied. Patients with R1 and R2 resections should be treated with doses of more than 68 Gy (2 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions/week) (with close margins [< 3 mm] more than 66 Gy) to achieve an improvement in locoregional control and survival.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite more than 70 randomised trials, the effect of chemotherapy on non-metastatic head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma remains uncertain. We did three meta-analyses of the impact of survival on chemotherapy added to locoregional treatment. METHODS: We updated data on all patients in randomised trials between 1965 and 1993. We included patients with carcinoma of the oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx, or hypopharynx. FINDINGS: The main meta-analysis of 63 trials (10,741 patients) of locoregional treatment with or without chemotherapy yielded a pooled hazard ratio of death of 0.90 (95% CI 0.85-0.94, p<0.0001), corresponding to an absolute survival benefit of 4% at 2 and 5 years in favour of chemotherapy. There was no significant benefit associated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy given concomitantly to radiotherapy gave significant benefits, but heterogeneity of the results prohibits firm conclusions. Meta-analysis of six trials (861 patients) comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with concomitant or alternating radiochemotherapy yielded a hazard ratio of 0.91 (0.79-1.06) in favour of concomitant or alternating radiochemotherapy. Three larynx-preservation trials (602 patients) compared radical surgery plus radiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in responders or radical surgery and radiotherapy in non-responders. The hazard ratio of death in the chemotherapy arm as compared with the control arm was 1.19 (0.97-1.46). INTERPRETATION: Because the main meta-analysis showed only a small significant survival benefit in favour of chemotherapy, the routine use of chemotherapy is debatable. For larynx preservation, the non-significant negative effect of chemotherapy in the organ-preservation strategy indicates that this procedure must remain investigational.},

	abstract = {Early detection and treatment improve the prognosis for oral cancer. Delays from the onset of symptoms to clinical diagnosis are common. Our aim is to identify factors associated with this delay. Between 1995 and 1998, we interviewed 105 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed oral cancer in Greece. If 21 or more days elapsed from the time the patient noticed major symptoms to a definitive diagnosis, we called it a delay (52% of cases). We used logistic and linear regression to estimate odds ratios of delayed diagnosis and to identify correlates of length of delay, respectively. Former smokers had a 4.3 times greater risk of delayed diagnosis compared with current smokers (95% confidence interval: 1.1-17.1). The length of delay was greater among single patients, non-smokers, or those with stage IV tumors. Clinicians should be advised that delay in the diagnosis of oral cancer occurs frequently, even in individuals who do not smoke heavily.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Tumor volume (TV) is one of the main reported factors determining the outcome of treatment in head-and-neck carcinomas. In this study, the prognostic impact of TV was explored in the context of a randomized trial with the patients assigned to receive standard radiotherapy (RT) alone or RT plus platinum compounds (RT alone, RT plus cisplatin, or RT plus carboplatin). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tumor outlines were traced and digitized on each pretreatment CT slice for each of the 101 patients studied. Taking into account the magnification factor of the scan and CT slice thickness, a computer with specifically designed software calculated the TV in cubic centimeters. RESULTS: The median overall survival for the whole group of patients was 21.6 months (95% confidence interval, 13.0-30.2) and the 3-year survival rate was 40%. The addition of platinum compounds to RT (Groups 2 and 3) significantly improved the survival rate (RT alone vs. RT plus cisplatin, hazard ratio 0.36, p = 0.002; RT alone vs. RT plus carboplatin, hazard ratio 0.53, p = 0.029). In univariate analysis, the most significant parameters for survival were treatment group, total gross tumor volume (TGTV), complete response, nodal GTV, primary GTV, and performance status. In multivariate analysis, treatment group, TGTV, gender, and primary site were independent prognostic factors for survival. A prognostic threshold of 22.8 cm(3) was detected for TGTV. Patients with a TGTV of <22.8 cm(3) were more likely to achieve a complete response and had a median survival of 45.3 months, and those with a TGTV >22.8 cm(3) had a median survival of 12.3 months (log-rank test, p = 0.0102). CONCLUSION: The prognostic significance of the TGTV was confirmed and a cutoff value of 22.8 cm(3) derived.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite significant advances and the use of new diagnosic and therapy methods to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), prognosis has improved only marginally in the last decades. Thus, there is an enormous need for novel immunotherapeutic approaches. It is becoming more and more obvious that stem cells play an important role in tumor development and progression. The identity of these cells and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain mostly unknown in HNSCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Solid tumors as well as cells from the peripheral blood of patients with HNSCC were analyzed by flow cytometry concerning the expression of different putative stem cell marker proteins. RESULTS: Distinct populations of CD44-positive (CD44+), lin-negative (lin-) potential stem cells could be identified in solid tumors of HNSCC patients with strong individual variations. Surprisingly, the potential stem cell marker CD44 was found to be constitutively expressed on the surface of all permanent HNSCC cell lines analyzed. CONCLUSION: These data strongly suggest that CD44+ tumor stem cells may play a key role in establishment of permanent HNSCC cell lines, selecting especially robust cell entities that in real life might drive progression and metastasis of HNSCC. Individual analysis of tumor stem cell markers will be an important tool for innovative therapies and prognosis of patients with HNSCC. Additional stem cell markers will be investigated concerning their expression and cellular function.},

	abstract = {Appropriate treatment of head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) remains one of the most difficult challenges in head and neck oncology. Overall survival of patients with HNSCC remains at approximately 50% at 5 years. Surgical therapy can be mutilating and often has significant effects on swallowing, speech, and physical appearance. The addition of chemotherapy to radiation treatment has shown efficacy in organ preservation in some sites in the head and neck, but has resulted in limited improvement in survival rates. HNSCC resistance to chemotherapy has limited the usefulness of chemotherapy in the treatment of this disease. We have recently demonstrated that human head and neck squamous cell cancers contain a tumorigenic, so-called cancer stem cell, subpopulation of cells that can self-renew and produce differentiated cells that form the bulk of the tumor. These tumorigenic HNSCC cells have a distinct phenotype and can be identified by a surface marker. Current treatment for HNSCC regimens may selectively kill the differentiated cancer cells, producing tumor regression while sparing the cancer stem cells, leading to tumor regrowth and relapse. It is important for us to understand why HNSCC does not respond to chemotherapy and to identify new targeted treatments that can overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes. Further study of HNSCC stem cells will increase our knowledge of this devastating disease and allow us to develop novel treatments.},

	abstract = {Cancer stem cells (CSC) have been identified in a growing number of human malignancies. CSC are functionally defined by their ability to self-renew and recapitulate tumors in the ectopic setting, and a growing number of studies have shown that they display other functional characteristics, such as invasion and drug resistance. These unique functional properties implicate a role for CSC in clinical consequences, such as initial tumor formation, relapse following treatment, metastasis, and resistance, suggesting they are a major factor in directing clinical outcomes. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a highly-aggressive disease with a propensity for early metastasis and drug resistance. Tumorigenic pancreatic cancer cells have been identified using the cell surface antigens CD44, CD24, and CD133, as well as the high expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that ALDH- and CD133-expressing pancreatic CSC have a greater propensity for metastasis, and ALDH-expressing CSC have been shown to be resistant to conventional chemotherapy. In clinical samples from patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the presence of ALDH-expressing CSC was associated with worse overall survival. The development of CSC-targeting therapies might be important in changing the clinical outcomes of patients with this disease, and others and we have begun to identify novel compounds that block CSC function. This review will discuss the biological and clinical relevance of CSC in pancreatic cancer, and will discuss novel therapeutic strategies to target them.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We describe the clinicopathologic and flow cytometric features of 10 cases of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (BSCC) of the head and neck to determine if DNA ploidy is a useful prognostic indicator. We also provide a review of 80 cases previously reported in the English language literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 10 cases were obtained from the surgical pathology files of Presbyterian University Hospital and The Eye and Ear Institute, Pittsburgh, PA (1987-1991). In all 10 cases, the microscopic slides and clinical data were reviewed. Flow cytometry was performed using the Hedley technique and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. RESULTS: The mean age of patients with BSCC was 64 years (range, 49 to 75 years). Tumor involved the base of tongue (n = 5), hypopharynx-epiglottis (n = 3), and tonsil (n = 1). One case presented with cervical lymph node metastasis from an unknown primary site. Histologically, BSCC showed a biphasic pattern with basaloid-squamous elements, comedonecrosis, stromal hyalinization, surface dysplasia, and an in situ and/or invasive squamous cell carcinoma component. Flow cytometry revealed six diploid and four aneuploid tumors. Five of six patients with diploid and all four patients with aneuploid tumors developed early regional and/or distant metastases. Of the two patients who died of disease, one had a diploid and the other an aneuploid tumor. CONCLUSION: Our study reaffirms the predilection of BSCC for the base of tongue, pyriform sinus, and supraglottic larynx, and its aggressive biologic behavior with a high incidence of cervical lymph node metastasis (64%), distant spread (44%), and death from disease (38% mortality at 17 months median follow-up). However, in contrast to previous reports, tumor ploidy by flow cytometry provided no additional prognostic information beyond that supplied by routine histologic evaluation.},

	abstract = {Although studies have established human papillomaviruses (HPVs) as a risk factor for oral and oropharyngeal cancer, it is not clear whether viral infection affects survival in head and neck malignancies. This investigation examined the relationship between HPV and survival in carcinomas of the oral cavity and oropharynx. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 139 newly diagnosed cases were tested for HPVs by PCR and DNA sequencing. Patient and tumor characteristics were obtained from questionnaires, pathology reports and cancer registries. Odds ratios (ORs) and relative risks (RRs) were based on logistic and Cox regression models, respectively. HPVs were detected in 21% of the tumors; 83% were HPV-16. Greater risk of HPV infection was associated with males (OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.0-8.6), a history of oral-genital sex (OR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.5-11.7), and oropharyngeal tumors (OR = 10.4, 95% CI = 3.5-31.2). As tobacco usage increased, the odds of HPV detection decreased (OR = 0.97/pack-year, 95% CI = 0.96-0.99). HPV infected patients had better overall survival (RR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-0.8) than those with HPV-negative tumors. There was an interaction between gender and HPV for overall (p = 0.05) and disease-specific (p = 0.03) survival that suggested that HPV infected males had better prognosis than HPV-negative males, but this was not the case among females. HPV status was identified as an independent prognostic factor in oral and oropharyngeal cancers. This result appeared to be gender-specific, suggesting the need for further study of the interaction between HPV and gender on survival.},

	abstract = {The human papillomavirus (HPV) family includes more than 170 different types of virus that infect stratified epithelium. High-risk HPV is well established as the primary cause of cervical cancer, but in recent years, a clear role for this virus in other malignancies is also emerging. Indeed, HPV plays a pathogenic role in a subset of head and neck cancers---mostly cancers of the oropharynx---with distinct epidemiological, clinical and molecular characteristics compared with head and neck cancers not caused by HPV. This review summarises our current understanding of HPV in these cancers, specifically detailing HPV infection in head and neck cancers within different racial/ethnic subpopulations, and the differences in various aspects of these diseases between women and men. Finally, we provide an outlook for this disease, in terms of clinical management, and consider the issues of `diagnostic biomarkers' and targeted therapies.},

	abstract = {This article compares the expression and applicability of biomarkers, from single genes and gene signatures, identified in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma using the GeneChip Human Transcriptome Array 2.0, nCounter, and real-time PCR analyses. Two multicenter, retrospective cohorts of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma from the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group who received postoperative radiochemotherapy or primary radiochemotherapy were considered. Real-time PCR was performed for a limited number of 38 genes of the cohort who received postoperative radiochemotherapy only. Correlations between the methods were evaluated by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Patients were stratified based on the expression of putative cancer stem cell markers, hypoxia-associated gene signatures, and a previously developed seven-gene signature. Locoregional tumor control was compared between these patient subgroups using log-rank tests. Gene expressions obtained from nCounter analyses were moderately correlated to GeneChip analyses (median rho = approximately 0.68). A higher correlation was obtained between nCounter analyses and real-time PCR (median rho = 0.84). Significant associations with locoregional tumor control were observed for most of the considered biomarkers evaluated by GeneChip and nCounter analyses. In general, all applied biomarkers (single genes and gene signatures) classified approximately 70% to 85% of the patients similarly. Overall, gene signatures seem to be more robust and had a better transferability among different measurement methods.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify and independently validate a novel gene signature predicting locoregional tumor control (LRC) for treatment individualization of patients with locally advanced HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) who are treated with postoperative radio(chemo)therapy (PORT-C).Experimental Design: Gene expression analyses were performed using NanoString technology on a multicenter training cohort of 130 patients and an independent validation cohort of 121 patients. The analyzed gene set was composed of genes with a previously reported association with radio(chemo)sensitivity or resistance to radio(chemo)therapy. Gene selection and model building were performed comparing several machine-learning algorithms.Results: We identified a 7-gene signature consisting of the three individual genes HILPDA, CD24, TCF3, and one metagene combining the highly correlated genes SERPINE1, INHBA, P4HA2, and ACTN1 The 7-gene signature was used, in combination with clinical parameters, to fit a multivariable Cox model to the training data (concordance index, ci = 0.82), which was successfully validated (ci = 0.71). The signature showed improved performance compared with clinical parameters alone (ci = 0.66) and with a previously published model including hypoxia-associated genes and cancer stem cell markers (ci = 0.65). It was used to stratify patients into groups with low and high risk of recurrence, leading to significant differences in LRC in training and validation (P < 0.001).Conclusions: We have identified and validated the first hypothesis-based gene signature for HPV-negative HNSCC treated by PORT-C including genes related to several radiobiological aspects. A prospective validation is planned in an ongoing prospective clinical trial before potential application in clinical trials for patient stratification. Clin Cancer Res; 24(6); 1364-74.

	abstract = {The relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 infection and p53 gene mutations was investigated in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN). HPV was detected by general primer-mediated and type-specific PCR. Alterations in the p53 gene were investigated using single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis in 27 SCCHN, of which 12 were HPV 16-positive and 15 were HPV-negative. Mutations were detected in 2/12 (16.7%) HPV 16-positive and 7/15 (46.7%) HPV-negative tumours; this difference was not statistically significant. The predominant mutations were deletions and C --> T transitions; G --> T transversions were found in only 2 tumours. Our results indicate that the presence of HPV 16 and p53 mutations is not mutually exclusive and detection of a p53 mutation does not exclude a potential role for HPV 16 in the pathogenesis of a subset of SCCHN.},

	abstract = {A multicenter case-control study was conducted during 1999-2002 in four European countries (Poland, Romania, Russia, and Slovakia) to evaluate the role of occupational exposures in risk of laryngeal/hypopharyngeal cancer. Male cancer cases (34 hypopharyngeal, 316 laryngeal) with full data on occupational history and nonoccupational factors were compared with 728 hospital controls for occupational exposure to 73 suspected carcinogens. Occupational history was evaluated by industrial hygienists blinded to case/control status. Elevated risks for ever exposure to coal dust were found for both hypopharyngeal (odds ratio (OR) = 4.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18, 14.89) and laryngeal (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 0.94, 3.47) cancer, with clear dose-response patterns. Inclusion of a 20-year lag in the analysis strengthened these associations. Hypopharyngeal cancer risk was also significantly associated with exposure to mild steel dust (OR = 3.04, 95% CI: 1.39, 6.64) and iron compounds and fumes (OR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.29, 5.84), without clear dose-response relations. Laryngeal cancer was significantly associated with exposure to hard-alloys dust (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.08, 4.57) and chlorinated solvents (OR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.03, 4.61), without dose-response relations. A possible link between high formaldehyde exposure and laryngeal cancer was suggested. No association was found for exposure to asbestos or inorganic acid mists. These data indicate that occupational exposure to coal dust may play a role in laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer. Other possible relations need further evaluation.},

@article{RN55,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: A significant proportion of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) are associated with the human papilloma virus (HPV), particularly HPV16. The optimal method for HPV determination on archival materials however, remains unclear. We compared a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay for HPV16 mRNA to a DNA in situ hybridization (ISH) method, and evaluated their significance for overall (OS) and disease-free (DFS) survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Matched, archival biopsies from 111 patients with OSCC were evaluated for HPV16 using a qRT-PCR for E6 mRNA and ISH for DNA. Immunohistochemistry for p16, p53, and epidermal growth factor receptor were also performed. RESULTS: HPV16 E6 mRNA was positive in 73 (66%) of 111 samples; ISH was positive in 62 of 106 samples (58%), with 86% concordance. P16 was overexpressed in 72 samples (65%), which was strongly associated with HPV16 status by either method. E6 mRNA presence or p16 overexpression were significantly associated with superior OS; E6 mRNA, HPV16 ISH, or p16 were all significantly associated with DFS. On multivariate analysis adjusted for age, stage, and treatment, positive E6 mRNA was the only independent predictor for superior OS; for DFS, p16 expression or HPV16 status determined by either method was significant. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HPV16 in OSCC ranges from 58% to 66%, in a recently treated Canadian cohort.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: A significant proportion of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) are associated with the human papilloma virus (HPV), particularly HPV16. The optimal method for HPV determination on archival materials however, remains unclear. We compared a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay for HPV16 mRNA to a DNA in situ hybridization (ISH) method, and evaluated their significance for overall (OS) and disease-free (DFS) survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Matched, archival biopsies from 111 patients with OSCC were evaluated for HPV16 using a qRT-PCR for E6 mRNA and ISH for DNA. Immunohistochemistry for p16, p53, and epidermal growth factor receptor were also performed. RESULTS: HPV16 E6 mRNA was positive in 73 (66%) of 111 samples; ISH was positive in 62 of 106 samples (58%), with 86% concordance. P16 was overexpressed in 72 samples (65%), which was strongly associated with HPV16 status by either method. E6 mRNA presence or p16 overexpression were significantly associated with superior OS; E6 mRNA, HPV16 ISH, or p16 were all significantly associated with DFS. On multivariate analysis adjusted for age, stage, and treatment, positive E6 mRNA was the only independent predictor for superior OS; for DFS, p16 expression or HPV16 status determined by either method was significant. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HPV16 in OSCC ranges from 58% to 66%, in a recently treated Canadian cohort. Classification of HPV-positivity by HPV16 E6 mRNA, HPV16 ISH or p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is associated with improved DFS. However, the latter two assays are technically easier to perform; hence, HPV16 ISH or p16 IHC should become standard evaluations for all patients with OSCC.},

	abstract = {The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis suggests that neoplastic clones are maintained exclusively by a rare fraction of cells with stem cell properties. Although the existence of CSCs in human leukaemia is established, little evidence exists for CSCs in solid tumours, except for breast cancer. Recently, we prospectively isolated a CD133+ cell subpopulation from human brain tumours that exhibited stem cell properties in vitro. However, the true measures of CSCs are their capacity for self renewal and exact recapitulation of the original tumour. Here we report the development of a xenograft assay that identified human brain tumour initiating cells that initiate tumours in vivo. Only the CD133+ brain tumour fraction contains cells that are capable of tumour initiation in NOD-SCID (non-obese diabetic, severe combined immunodeficient) mouse brains. Injection of as few as 100 CD133+ cells produced a tumour that could be serially transplanted and was a phenocopy of the patient's original tumour, whereas injection of 10(5) CD133- cells engrafted but did not cause a tumour. Thus, the identification of brain tumour initiating cells provides insights into human brain tumour pathogenesis, giving strong support for the CSC hypothesis as the basis for many solid tumours, and establishes a previously unidentified cellular target for more effective cancer therapies.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In a prospective randomized clinical study, simultaneous postoperative application of irradiation (RT), mitomycin C, and bleomycin was tested in a group of patients with operable advanced head-and-neck carcinoma. It was expected that the planned combined postoperative therapy would reduce the number of locoregional recurrences and prolong survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 114 eligible patients with Stage III or IV squamous cell head-and-neck carcinoma were randomized to receive postoperative RT alone (Group 1) or RT combined with simultaneous mitomycin C and bleomycin (Group 2). Patients were stratified according to the stage and site of the primary tumor and the presence or absence of high-risk prognostic factors. Primary surgical treatment was performed with curative intent in all patients. Patients in both groups were postoperatively irradiated to the total dose of 56-70 Gy. Chemotherapy included mitomycin C 15 mg/m(2) after 10 Gy and 5 mg of bleomycin twice a week during RT to the planned total dose of 70 mg. RESULTS: At 2 years, patients in the radiochemotherapy group had better locoregional control (86%) than those in the RT alone group (69%; p = 0.037). Disease-free survival and overall survival was also better in the radiochemotherapy group compared with the RT-alone group (76% vs. 60%, p = 0.099; and 74% vs. 64%, p = 0.036, respectively). Patients who benefited from chemotherapy were those with high-risk factors. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study indicate that concomitant postoperative radiochemotherapy with mitomycin C and bleomycin improves locoregional control and survival in patients with advanced head-and-neck carcinoma. The patients who benefited from chemotherapy were those with high-risk factors.},

	abstract = {There are few well-established patient risk factors associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in cancers of the oral cavity and oropharynx. The purpose of this study was to determine if there were significant different risk factors and tumor characteristics between HPV-positive and HPV-negative cancer cases. HPV was evaluated in cancer tissue and exfoliated oral cells of 193 oral cavity/oropharynx cancer patients using PCR and direct DNA sequencing. A patient questionnaire collected information about risk factors, sexual practices and medical history. The prevalence of HPV high-risk (HR) types was 20% in cancer cases. Three types were identified: HPV-16 (87%), HPV-18 (3%) and HPV-33 (11%). Risk factors for HPV-HR included younger age (< or = 55 years vs. > 55 years; adjusted OR = 3.4; 95% CI = 1.6-7.3) and younger-age cases who had more lifetime sex partners (adjusted OR = 3.8; 95% CI = 1.4-10.1), practiced oral-genital sex (adjusted OR = 4.3; 95% CI = 1.8-10.4) or oral-anal sex (adjusted OR = 19.5; 95% CI = 3.4-113). Compared to HPV-negative cancers, HPV-HR cancers were more likely to have a positive HPV-HR exfoliated oral cytology test (adjusted OR = 7.8; 95% CI = 3.4-18.4), later stage (adjusted OR = 3.0), nodal involvement (adjusted OR = 4.1) and advanced grade (adjusted OR = 3.0). This study shows new evidence that the prevalence of oncogenic mucosal HPV is higher in younger-age oral cavity/oropharynx cancer cases whose sexual practices are typically associated with sexual transmission of the virus. HPV detection also appears to be an indicator of advanced disease characteristics that may require different clinical treatment for this subset of patients. An exfoliated oral cytology test for HPV was a significant predictor of HR types in the cancers, suggesting that an oral rinse may provide an early biomarker of infected tumors.},

	abstract = {The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was assessed in biopsies of tonsillar carcinomas (n = 10) and cases of tonsillitis (n = 7), serving as controls, by general-primer-mediated PCR (GP-PCR). All carcinomas appeared HPV-positive, whereas all cases of tonsillitis were HPV-negative. Additional type-specific PCR for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31 and 33 revealed that 4 carcinomas contained HPV 16 DNA, 4 contained HPV 33 DNA and 1 contained an HPV 16/33 double infection. False positivity was excluded by additional Southern blot analysis of type-specific PCR-positive samples (n = 4). Further characterization of GP-PCR products by sequence analysis revealed that 2 carcinomas contained still uncharacterized HPV genotypes; one of these also contained HPV 33 DNA and one was negative by type-specific PCR. Application of RNA PCR revealed expression of HPV 16 or HPV 33 E7 encoding spliced E6*1 transcripts in all tonsillar carcinomas (n = 4) examined. Additional non-radioactive RNA in situ hybridization performed on 3 biopsies revealed the presence of HPV 16 or HPV 33 E7 transcripts exclusively localized within the carcinoma cells, whereas stroma stained negative. These findings strongly support a role for certain HPV types in the pathogenesis of tonsillar carcinomas.},

The goal of this study was to evaluate p16 in the context of HPV16 and examine p16 survival outcomes in HPV16 positive and HPV16 negative site-specific HNSCC. p16 and HPV16 status were determined by immunohistochemistry and qPCR respectively, on 80 primary HNSCC from four sites: OC, OP, larynx and HP. p16 expression was different across sites (p<0.001), was more frequent in OP than non-OP sites (p<0.0001), and was different between Caucasian Americans (CA) and African Americans (AA) (p=0.031), similar to HPV (p=0.013). p16 was associated with marital status (p=0.008) and smoking (p=0.014). p16 positive patients had improved survival (similar to HPV16 positive cases). Patients with p16 negative/HPV16 negative status had the worst survival for all sites combined as well as for OP. p16 status is an important prognostic indicator in both OPSCC and non-OPSCC and the p16 positive/HPV16 negative group is likely a distinct subgroup lacking any HPV genotype. Cohorts with larger representations of non-OP sites examining multiple molecular markers will be key to deciphering and dissecting out p16's role as a useful prognostic indicator when assessed in combination with HPV status.},

	abstract = {The trends in head and neck cancer incidence and smoking prevalence are reviewed, discussing where such trends parallel but also how and why they may not. In the U.S., public health efforts at tobacco control and education have successfully reduced the prevalence of cigarette smoking, resulting in a lower incidence of head and neck cancer. Vigilance at preventing tobacco use and encouraging cessation should continue, and expanded efforts should target particular ethnic and socioeconomic groups. However, an unfortunate stagnation has been observed in oropharyngeal cancer incidence and likely reflects a rising attribution of this disease to oncogenic human papillomavirus, in particular type 16 (HPV-16). For the foreseeable future, this trend in oropharyngeal cancer incidence may continue, but with time the effects of vaccination of the adolescent and young adult female population should result in a lower viral prevalence and hopefully a reduced incidence of oropharyngeal cancer. To hasten the reduction of HPV-16 prevalence in the population, widespread vaccination of adolescent and young adult males should also be considered.},

These cancers remain difficult to treat and treatment can cause severe, long-term side effects. For patients who are not cured by surgery and/or (chemo)radiotherapy, there are few effective treatment options. Targeted therapies and predictive biomarkers are urgently needed in order to improve the management and minimise the treatment toxicity, and to allow selection of patients who are likely to benefit from both nonselective and targeted therapies. This clinical update aims to provide an insight into the current understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of the disease, and explores the novel therapies under development and in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic abilities of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) based on the architectural changes in the nodal parenchyma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied histologically proven 70 metastatic and 52 reactive nodes in the necks of 38 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas who had undergone both CT and MRI. We assessed the detectability of the architectural changes in the nodal parenchyma that were suggestive of cancer focus (cancer nest, necrosis, and keratinization). The diagnostic abilities of CT and MRI were assessed by three observers separately for the small (<10 mm in minimum axis diameter) and large (>or=10 mm) nodes. RESULTS: MRI was significantly more effective than CT in diagnosing small metastatic nodes, yielding 83% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and 86% accuracy. However, the diagnostic abilities of MRI and CT were similar for large metastatic nodes; MRI yielded 100% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and 99% accuracy. receiver operating characteristic analysis also indicated that the Az values were significantly higher for MRI than for CT (0.927 vs. 0.822, P = 0.00054) for the detection of small nodes. CONCLUSION: MRI is superior to CT in the diagnosis of metastatic nodes from head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.},

The HPV antiserum used was prepared in guinea pigs immunized against the purified HPV virions from human common wart tissue. Of the tumors studied, 36% showed the presence of HPV antigens. In that, one-third of the flat and inverted lesions and 42% of the papillomatous lesions contained cells with intranuclear HPV-staining reaction. The role of HPV as the etiologic agent of laryngeal squamous cell papillomas is discussed, as is the potential malignant transformation of them.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide information on the effects of alcohol and tobacco on laryngeal cancer and its subsites. METHODS: This was a case-control study conducted between 1992 and 2000 in northern Italy and Switzerland. A total of 527 cases of incident squamous-cell carcinoma of the larynx and 1297 hospital controls frequency-matched with cases on age, sex, and area of residence were included. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: In comparison with never smokers, ORs were 19.8 for current smokers and 7.0 for ex-smokers. The risk increased in relation to the number of cigarettes (OR = 42.9 for > or = 25 cigarettes/day) and for duration of smoking (OR = 37.2 for > or = 40 years). For alcohol, the risk increased in relation to number of drinks (OR = 5.9 for > or = 56 drinks per week). Combined alcohol and tobacco consumption showed a multiplicative (OR = 177) rather than an additive risk. For current smokers and current drinkers the risk was higher for supraglottis (ORs 54.9 and 2.6, respectively) than for glottis (ORs 7.4 and 1.8) and others subsites (ORs 10.9 and 1.9). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that both cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking are independent risk factors for laryngeal cancer. Heavy consumption of alcohol and cigarettes determined a multiplicative risk increase, possibly suggesting biological synergy.},

The records of 187 patients with tumors diagnosed as laryngeal spindle cell (sarcomatoid) carcinoma were retrieved from the files of the Otorhinolaryngic Tumor Registry of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. There were 174 men and 13 women, 35-92 years of age (average, 65.6 years). Nearly all patients experienced hoarseness (n = 165 [88%] patients) for a mean duration of 11.0 months. Patients admitted to smoking (n = 162 [87%] patients) and/or alcohol use (n = 90 [48%] patients). Most tumors were glottic (n = 132 [71%]), T1 (n = 111 [59%]), 1 and polypoid (n = 185 [99%]), with a mean tumor size of 1.8 cm. Histologically, squamous cell carcinoma (n = 157 [84%]) was noted, ulcerated, and blended with the spindle cell component, which was most frequently arranged in a storiform pattern (n = 92 [49%] tumors). Foci of benign or malignant cartilage and/or bone (n = 13 [7%]) were noted in the spindle cell component. All patients were treated with surgery (n = 90 [48%] patients) or surgery with radiation (n = 97 [52%] patients). Recurrences developed in 85 (45%) patients. Overall, T1 glottic tumors managed by complete surgical eradication had the best outcome (mean follow-up, 7.8 years).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To define the necessity of neck ultrasound for investigation of T1 and T2 oral tongue carcinoma with N0 neck. METHODS: The medical records of all patients with early stage (T1-2 N0) oral tongue cancer treated surgically between January 1985 and December 2000 were reviewed. Patients with 30 neck dissections were identified for analysis. The result of neck ultrasound examination was correlated with the histological examination. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of ultrasound examination were found to be 47%, 93% and 70%, respectively. The implication of ultrasound examination with respect to elective neck treatment was discussed in the management of the N0 neck. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that ultrasound alone is inadequate for making decisions regarding neck management of patients with T1 and T2 N0 carcinoma of the tongue and cannot replace a policy of elective neck dissection.},

	abstract = {The quest for improved fractionation and combined modality regimens in head and neck cancer has also yielded progressively higher rates of toxicity. Time compression of dose delivery in accelerated fractionation has produced high rates of severe mucositis including the early stoppage of two randomized trials. The addition of chemotherapy has introduced systemic toxicity and can exacerbate local tissue reactions when used concurrent with radiotherapy. Mucositis is recognized as the principal impediment to efforts at further treatment intensification. The development and utilization of standardized toxicity grading criteria and accepted reporting standards has lagged toxicity production, impeding a full appreciation of the true extent of both acute and late toxicity. Objective data regarding acute and chronic effects on organ function are also sorely lacking. A better characterization of the frequency, severity, and duration of the various toxicities encountered in head and neck cancer will also allow the rational development of toxicity interventions. New methods are needed to summarize the global or aggregate toxicity of a treatment program. Further research into the assessment and analysis of toxicity is not only crucial to improvements in quality of life (QOL), but perhaps, improved rates of disease control as well.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine the frequency of mucositis and associated outcomes in patients receiving radiotherapy (RT) for head and neck cancer through a systematic review of recently published literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to the study protocol, databases were searched for randomized clinical trials (English only, 1996-1999) of patients with head and neck cancer receiving RT with or without chemotherapy that reported one or more outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies (n=6181 patients) met inclusion criteria. Mucositis was defined using a variety of scoring systems. The mean incidence was 80%. Over one-half of patients (56%) who received altered fractionation RT (RT-AF) experienced severe mucositis (grades 3-4) compared to 34% of patients who received conventional RT. Rates of hospitalization due to mucositis, reported in three studies (n=700), were 16% overall and 32% for RT-AF patients. Eleven percent of patients had RT regimens interrupted or modified because of mucositis in five studies (n=1267) reporting this outcome. Data insufficiency or heterogeneity prohibited analysis of mucositis severity and other associated outcomes, such as oral pain, dysphagia and opioid use. CONCLUSIONS: Mucositis is a frequent, severe toxicity in patients treated with RT for head and neck cancer. While it appears that mucositis may lead to hospitalization and treatment interruptions, its overall impact on outcomes has not been adequately investigated.},

@article{RN255,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to examine deficiencies in established methods of summarising adverse events, and to create a new reporting system (TAME) for summarising the toxicity burden of cancer treatment. TAME consolidates traditional adverse-event data into three risk domains: short-term (acute) Toxicity (T), Adverse long-term (late) effects (A), and Mortality risk (M) generated by a treatment programme (E=End results); and assigns treatments to risk classes for each risk domain. METHODS: We examined formally an established method for summarising adverse events (the max-grade method) in five trials of patients with head and neck cancer done between September, 1991, and August, 2000, by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) that involved 13 treatment groups (2304 patients). We calculated TAME summary metrics that included time and multiplicity factors in the same patient groups. We compared relative T values with relative values for toxic effects from the max-grade approach. We also calculated the range of individual patient T scores in two groups from one of the trials (the laryngeal-preservation trial). RESULTS: The max-grade method systematically excluded 29-70% of total reported high-grade (grade 3-4) acute adverse events, contained progressive bias, and favoured higher toxicity programmes. Relative T values in the 13 treatment programmes tested showed an increase of almost 500% in acute toxicity burden (100-590) between treatment groups compared with a 170% increase (100-270) between treatment groups by use of the max-grade method. The difference between these two summary systems was statistically significant (mean difference -102 [95% CI -167 to -37], p=0.005, t test for paired differences). Four risk classes were designated for acute and relative late effects: low (100-140), moderate (150-390), high (400-490), and extreme (>or=500). The distribution of individual patient T scores showed that 82 (60%) patients who received concurrent platinum-radiotherapy for larynx preservation reported two or more high-grade events, and 34 (20%) reported four or more high-grade events; these findings differed significantly from the distribution of individual patient T scores for patients who received radiotherapy alone, in which 32 (19%) reported two or more high-grade events and 3 (3%) reported four or more high-grade events (p<0.0001). The max-grade method also systematically excluded 26-48% of high-grade (grade 3-4) late adverse events. However, less variation was noted in the relative risk of late events (100-270) by the TAME method for late effects. INTERPRETATION: Traditional methods for summarising adverse events systematically exclude important data, giving an inaccurate impression of the toxicity burden in complex multimodality trials. By contrast, T values use data on all high-grade adverse events. T values are proportional to the intensity of treatment, showing a 500% increase between treatment groups in acute toxicity burden in RTOG trials of head and neck cancer done during this study interval. TAME reporting provides a concise and uniform method to compare relative risk among treatment options. Future studies should include testing the performance of the TAME system in additional datasets (from different research organisations and disease sites), prospective correlation of TAME endpoints with predefined outcome measures, and assessment of its usefulness in clinical decision making.},

Since that time, human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma has been identified as a unique disease, with improved survival regardless of treatment modality. The improved outcomes of this population has led to re-evaluation of treatment paradigms in the past decade, with a desire to spare young, human papillomavirus-positive patients the treatment-related toxicities of chemoradiotherapy and to use new minimally invasive surgical techniques to improve outcomes. Numerous retrospective and prospective studies have investigated the role of surgery in treatment of oropharyngeal carcinoma and have demonstrated equivalent oncologic outcomes and improved functional outcomes compared with chemoradiotherapy protocols. Ongoing and future clinical trials may help delineate the role of surgery in the future.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the optimal combination of preoperative examination methods to predict mandibular invasion by squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Data were gathered prospectively but evaluated retrospectively. The preoperative results of clinical examination, conventional radiography, bone single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were compared to the histological results of resection specimens from 67 patients with tumours, adjacent or fixed to the mandible, histologically confirmed as squamous cell carcinoma. The examination methods with acceptable sensitivity and specificity were selected and diagnostic algorithms were constructed using all possible combinations. The preferred diagnostic algorithm was found to be either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, followed by a bone SPECT in cases where the first scan is negative. A negative bone SPECT rules out mandibular invasion (100% sensitivity). This algorithm accurately predicted mandibular invasion in 85% of the patients, without yielding false negative results. In this study group, application of such an algorithm would have resulted in a reduction of the number of unnecessary mandibular resections by 50%. The suggested, preferred, diagnostic algorithm shortens the preoperative screening process, avoiding unnecessary costs, as well as considerably reducing the number of unnecessary mandibular resections.},

	abstract = {In a recently held WHO workshop it has been recommended to abandon the distinction between potentially malignant lesions and potentially malignant conditions and to use the term potentially malignant disorders instead. Of these disorders, leukoplakia and erythroplakia are the most common ones. These diagnoses are still defined by exclusion of other known white or red lesions. In spite of tremendous progress in the field of molecular biology there is yet no single marker that reliably enables to predict malignant transformation in an individual patient. The general advice is to excise or laser any oral of oropharyngeal leukoplakia/erythroplakia, if feasible, irrespective of the presence or absence of dysplasia. Nevertheless, it is actually unknown whether such removal truly prevents the possible development of a squamous cell carcinoma. At present, oral lichen planus seems to be accepted in the literature as being a potentially malignant disorder, although the risk of malignant transformation is lower than in leukoplakia. There are no means to prevent such event. The efficacy of follow-up of oral lichen planus is questionable. Finally, brief attention has been paid to oral submucous fibrosis, actinic cheilitis, some inherited cancer syndromes and immunodeficiency in relation to cancer predisposition.},

The aim of this study was to define the accuracy of clinical and MRI T staging of oral cavity and base of the tongue tumors and correlate the results with pathological data. Mandibular involvement, in a subgroup of patients, was determined and sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and positive and negative predictive values were evaluated. Fifty-nine patients affected by squamous cell carcinoma and 1 case of adenoido-cystic carcinoma were examined by means of a superconductive MR unit, using SE T1, and fat-suppressed T2 weighted sequences before contrast medium infusion. SE T1 and T1 fat-suppressed sequences after gadolinium-DTPA infusion were used. T stage accuracy of both clinical examination and MRI were found to be respectively 62% (k 0.459) and 82% (k 0.775). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of MRI in the detection of mandibular involvement were 94.1%, 60% and 81.5%, while the positive and negative predictive values were 80% and 85.7%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of clinical examination in the detection of mandibular involvement were 100%, 30% and 74.1%, while the positive and negative predictive values were 70.8% and 100%. In the present study, MRI was seen to be an adequate technique for the assessment of oral cavity malignancies, in the evaluation of depth invasion, presence and extension of mandibular involvement.},

The review focuses primarily on several high-risk countries in an attempt to gain insight into the geographic variations in the incidence of this cancer in the globe and to relate the high incidence in some populations to their life style. With an estimated half a million cases around the globe and the rising trends reported in some populations, particularly in the young, urgent public health measures are needed to reduce the incidence and mortality of oral and oropharyngeal cancer.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We sought to determine the prevalence of biologically relevant human papillomavirus (HPV) in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Retinoblastoma (Rb) downregulation by HPV E7 results in p16 upregulation. We hypothesized that p16 overexpression in OSCC defines HPV-induced tumors with favorable prognosis. METHODS: Using real-time polymerase chain reaction for HPV16, we determined HPV16 viral load in a cohort of 79 OSCCs annotated with long-term patient follow-up. A tissue microarray including these cases was also analyzed for p53, p16, and Rb utilizing in situ quantitative protein expression analysis. Seventy-seven tumors were classified into a three-class model on the basis of p16 expression and HPV-DNA presence: class I, HPV-, p16 low; class II, HPV+, p16 low; and class III, HPV+, p16 high. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of OSCCs were HPV16+; HPV status alone was of no prognostic value for local recurrence and was barely significant for survival times. Overall survival was improved in class III (79%) compared with the other two classes (20% and 18%; P = .0095). Disease-free survival for the same class was 75% versus 15% and 13% (P = .0025). The 5-year local recurrence was 14% in class III versus 45% and 74% (P = .03). Only patients in class III had significantly lower p53 and Rb expression (P = .017 and .001, respectively). Multivariable survival analysis confirmed the prognostic value of the three-class model. CONCLUSION: Using this system for classification, we define the molecular profile of HPV+ OSCC with favorable prognosis, namely HPV+/p16 high (class III). This study defines a novel classification scheme that may have value for patient stratification for clinical trials testing HPV-targeted therapies.},

	abstract = {The 10 year follow-up of a clinical trial involving the comparison of 3F/wk versus 5F/wk in radiotherapy of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and hypopharynx has now been completed. The trial involved an intake of 734 patients between 1966 and 1975. The classification of all patients has been revised to conform with the latest TNM publication. A reduction in total dose was made for 3F/wk compared with 5F/wk. This varied between 13% and 11% in centres treating over 3 weeks and 6 weeks, respectively. No statistically significant differences have been found between the two arms (3F/wk versus 5F/wk) of the trial in any of the main group analyses. A number of sub-group analyses relating to survival, tumour-free and laryngectomy-free rates and to the comparison of acute or late normal-tissue radiation damage have also been performed. No differences have been found that could be considered to be statistically significant in relation to the particular sub-group. Previous interim reports suggested minor differences in sub-group analyses between the 3F/wk and 5F/wk regimes in this trial; these have diminished now that the full follow-up data are available. This trial has provided evidence on which clinicians may base their choice between either a 3F/wk fractionation regime or a conventional 5F/wk treatment protocol in the treatment of carcinoma of the laryngo-pharynx.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The treatment of oral cancer has a strong impact on the quality of life. In recent years different therapeutic concepts have been developed, these include preoperative simultaneous "neoadjuvant" radiochemotherapy (RCT) and one-stage surgery with tumor ablation and reconstruction. When considering long-term survival, there is substantial evidence that evidenced modality treatment including neoadjuvant RCT is superior to the primary surgical approach with postoperative radiation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This longitudinal study prospectively evaluates quality of life in two groups consisting of 53 neoadjuvant and primarily surgically treated patients with oral cancer, using the quality-of-life core questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the head and neck cancer module (H and N 35) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). RESULTS: Postoperatively both groups showed a marked reduction in quality of life. 1 year later quality of life had equalized between the two groups to such an extent that the quality of life scores had almost reached the preoperative level. Both groups showed specific impairments in the symptom scales. In the neoadjuvant therapy group however, global health and the emotional status were reduced to a greater degree than in the other group. CONCLUSION: Temporary limitations in quality of life can be expected after tumor treatment of oral cancer as presented here. Neoadjuvant therapy concept is more aggressive and might result in a longer disease-free survival, but the restriction in quality of life is more severe. Primary goal is the eradication of the tumor. Nevertheless preservation or reconstruction of a maximum of function is essential for a high level of quality of life.},

	abstract = {Our recent analysis of papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in different malignant head and neck tumors revealed that HPV infections occurred most frequently in tonsillar carcinomas (58%) and that 84% of positive cases contained the highly oncogenic HPV type 16. We could also present data in favor of the hypothesis that in view of their clinical behavior and the involved risk factors HPV-positive and HPV-negative tonsillar carcinomas may represent two separate tumor entities. Looking for a surrogate marker, which in further epidemiological studies could replace the laborious and expensive HPV detection/typing we analyzed p16 protein expression in 34 tonsillar carcinomas for their correlation with HPV status. p16 is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 which activate the negative cell cycle regulator protein pRB which in turn downregulates p16 expression. It could be shown that in neoplastic cells of the cervix uteri E7 protein of the high-risk HPVs can interfere with this regulatory circuit by its virtue to inactivate pRB and thus lead to the overexpession of p16. We found 53% of the tested tonsillar carcinomas to be HPV positive. 56% of all tumors tested were immunohistochemically positive for the p16 protein. In 16 of 18 of the HPV-positive carcinomas diffuse p16 expression was observed. In contrast, only 1 of the HPV-negative carcinomas showed focal p16 staining (p < 0.001). Clinical outcome analysis revealed a significant correlation of p16 expression with increased disease-free survival (p = 0.02). These data indicate that p16 is a technically simple immunohistological marker, applicable for routine pathological histology, and its prognostic value for survival is fully equivalent to HPV DNA detection.},

To investigate the importance of extent of extracapsular spread; the relationship between extracapsular spread and both traditional measures of metastatic disease and clinical/histological features of the primary tumour, and to determine their relative prognostic significance. The survival of 173 patients undergoing radical surgery and simultaneous neck dissection for oral/oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with histologically confirmed nodal metastasis and followed for 2.2-12.3 years is reported and related to pathological features. The most predictive clinical/histopathological features were determined by Cox regression modelling. The 3-year survival probability was similar for patients with macroscopic and only microscopic extracapsular spread (33 and 36%, respectively, compared with 72% for patients with intranodal metastasis). The Cox model showed the most predictive factor was extracapsular spread followed by status of resection margins. Extracapsular spread should be incorporated into pathological staging systems. Even microscopic extracapsular spread is of critical importance and must be sought especially in small-volume metastatic disease.},

	abstract = {Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) has been known to have oncogenic properties during latent infection in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Our studies focused on the role of LMP1 in NPC, and showed that LMP1 triggers the NF-kappaB, AP-1 and STAT signaling pathways. Strikingly, LMP1 was found to mediate the formation of a new heterodimer between c-Jun and JunB. Also, we have identified JAK/STAT and PI-PLC-PKC activation triggered by LMP1 through upregulating the expression of JAK3 and enhancing the phosphorylation of STAT. The constitutive activation of these signaling cascades explains LMP1's ability to induce such a diverse array of morphological and phenotypic effects in cells and provides insight into how LMP1 may induce cell transformation, in which multihit targeted genes in the downstream play an essential role. All signaling cascades triggered by LMP1 ultimately lead to the disruption of the cell cycle: the acceleration of G1/S phase and the arrest of G2/M phase. We also found that LMP1 induced the expression of hTERT and promoted cell immortalization. Importantly, by intervening physical intracellular signal transduction pathways and disturbing the progression of the cell cycle, LMP1, an important oncoprotein encoded by EBV, is thought to be a key modulator in the pathogenesis of NPC. Interfering LMP1 signaling could be a promising strategy to target the malignant phenotype of NPC.},
